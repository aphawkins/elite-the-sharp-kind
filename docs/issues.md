# Issues

## To get to MVP
- Fix code directory structure
- Check mission triggers (FAQ)
- Check ship stats (FAQ)
- Make number of stars proportional to screen size
- Make random class mockable
- Measure/improve code complexity
- Add Github actions
- Remove conditional compilation
- Enemy lasers don't always reach the full extent of the view
- Don't include a default config and don't error if one doesn't exist
- WinSound isn't playing music and sfx simoultaneously (e.g. docking computer and laser)

## Future (create github issues)
- Lone ships are flagged not separate ships
- Inject options
- Fix graphics scale setting rendering issues
- Make Sun and Stations coexist?
- Laser target shape by type
- Joystick support needs adding back
- Intro2 parade doesn't show all ships, maybe it should
- Add unit tests
- Add Trumbles mission
- SDL2 support
- Separate game speed from framerate
- Wireframe planet at the moment we just draw a circle. Need to add in the two arcs and crater that the original Elite had
- Bits of hidden surfaces on ships sometimes show through.  
- Buying more than 255g of Gold/Platinum doesn't work.  It didn't in the original Elite either.  Broken as designed.
- Make window resizable
- Use System.Numerics for all matrix and vector maths
- Separate tactics from rendering?
