- Inject options
- Intro2 parade doesn't show all ships, maybe it should
- Add unit tests
- Wireframe planet at the moment we just draw a circle. Need to add in the two arcs and crater that the original Elite had
- Bits of hidden surfaces on ships sometimes show through (parts drawn as lines?)  
- Buying more than 255g of Gold/Platinum doesn't work.  It didn't in the original Elite either.  Broken as designed.
- Make window resizable
- Use System.Numerics for all matrix and vector maths
- Separate tactics from rendering?
