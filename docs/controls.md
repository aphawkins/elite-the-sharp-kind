and the Enter/Return key to change it. The options can be saved as default for future games by pressing Enter
while on the Save Settings option (NB this is not necessary if you want to change the settings just for
the current game).  Game settings are held in the newkind.cfg file which should be in the same directory
as the newkind.exe file.
