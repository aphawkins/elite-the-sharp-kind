# Release Notes

## Unreleased

### Elite

#### Changes

- Ordered dithering costs nothing extra on solid faces — the same picture, at the undithered frame rate
- Gouraud shading draws about three times as fast — the same picture, cheaper colour matching and blending
- The label below the 8-bit scanner now reads "ELITE#"

#### Fixes

- The launch, docking and hyperspace rings no longer run off the top and bottom of the screen
- Explosions are round — the debris cloud was a square box
- Explosion clouds are the same size relative to the ship on both renditions
- 8-bit left and right screen border drawn one pixel wide instead of two
- The ship parade's fire button now starts the game, as its prompt says it does
- 16-bit speed bar drawn short and one row out of its slot

## v1.1.0 (2026-09-05)

### Elite

#### Features

- Yaw — a third flight axis, opt-in via `ELITE_DEBUG_YAW`, joystick-twist support
- Gouraud shading and flat per-face (Lambert) lighting on the 16-bit rendition
- Frustum culling and level-of-detail dropping for distant ships
- Elite now defaults to the 8-bit rendition
- Ships: 33 hardcoded classes replaced by one data table, `ships.json`
- Market wares become a plugin + JSON file; market and inventory screens now scroll

#### Fixes

- Intro screen was leaking chart keys and title music into the game
- Scanner stalk-to-blip gap
- Case-sensitive save-file loading on Linux
- A rejected save now says which field failed, and why

### Stunt Car Racer

#### Features

- Gamepad and joystick support — pad and one-stick joystick, live together
- Outside/chase camera view, on Backspace
- Mid-race 'M' returns to the track menu
- 'R' turns the car around
- Race pause (P/O) and debug freezes + stats overlay (F5/F6/F7)
- F9/F10 tune the physics frame gap live

#### Fixes

- A brief key press on the track-preview screen was sometimes ignored

### Engine

#### Features

- Gamepad and joystick support — shared input abstraction, hot-plug, both games
    - Speedlink Competition Pro Extra Joystick (USB)
    - Microsoft Wireless Controller for XBox One (Model 1708)
    - Microsoft Precision 2 Joystick (USB)
- Alpha blending (transparency) in both graphics backends
- Bilinear filtering and mipmaps for textured triangles
- One text rasteriser for both backends — Bitmap, `.fon` and TrueType font kinds, switchable live
- Game loop now runs at the configured frame rate, not a fixed 13.5 Hz tick
- Golden-trace and frame-check regression harness
- Goods (economy/market wares) become a plugin family, like missions and renditions
- Unit/integration test-level split; coverage measurement corrected

#### Fixes

- A startup failure now shows a dialog instead of silently crashing

## v1.0.0 (2026-08-09)

Initial release of Elite and Stunt Car Racer. Both games playable, but not fully feature complete and some known bugs remain.

  - Constrictor hunt
  - Thargoid plans
  - Debug mission-briefing cycling, `ELITE_DEBUG_MISSIONS`

  - Views, HUD and art as a swappable assembly

#### Fixes

- Missile detonation distance — was missing corner hits
- Mining/Military Laser tech-level gating
- Bounty hunters never turned hostile
- Police-spawn legal-status check was inverted
- Asteroid loot drops (splinters vs. alloy/cargo)
- Witchspace Thargoid ambush count
- Fuel-scooping rate, ~40x too fast
- Full-hold scooping always damaged the ship

- Docking Computer price
- Energy bomb sparing the Constrictor

- Full conversion playable end to end — all eight original tracks
- Track menu, preview, race and game-over flow with orbiting camera
- Graphical cockpit dashboard — wheels, engine flare, damage crack, gauges
- Car mesh loaded as a `.obj` asset
- Opponent AI — scripted speeds, steering, collision, push/obstruct
- Amiga-derived fixed-point physics for car and opponent
- Z-buffered track rendering — fixes floating-track and spurious-triangle bugs
- Car wrecks at full damage
- Lap-time clock — current and best lap
- Per-effect sound volume, pitch and pan — damage-scaled creak, pitched off-road/scrape
- Persisted settings — music/effects on or off

### Engine (`SharpKind.*`)

- Shared engine libraries split out of both games — graphics, audio, input, assets, config, timing
- Cross-platform SDL3 backend: Windows, Linux x64, Linux ARM64
- Software (CPU) and Hardware (SDL-accelerated) rendering, switchable in config
- Shared software z-buffer polygon renderer for both games
- Custom BMP and PNG decoders — no third-party imaging library
- Multi-resolution tiers: 8-bit and 16-bit asset sets with their own palette, fonts and colour budget
- Shared near-plane clipping and real per-vertex depth testing
- Hidden-line removal for wireframe rendering
- Versioned JSON config — auto-repairs a bad value instead of resetting the whole file
- Window Scale setting — integer window magnification, independent of resolution
- Graphic style, depth-sort strategy and colour-quantisation settings
- Widget/control library (`SharpKind.UI`) — Label, ComboBox, settings screens built on it
- Shared composition root (`SharpKind.App`) — one DI-based startup for both games
- Structured logging to console + rolling daily file, level set by environment variable
- Seedable, injectable randomness shared by both games
- Headless test harnesses — scripted keyboard input and frame dumps, for both games
- Central NuGet package management and code-quality analyser gates
- Tag-driven semantic versioning and automated GitHub Releases (win-x64 / linux-x64 / linux-arm64)
- `SharpKind.*` libraries published to NuGet.org on release, via Trusted Publishing
- Coverage badge and benchmark-history tracking in CI
