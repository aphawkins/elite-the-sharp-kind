# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format
is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); the project does
not yet cut versioned releases, so everything sits under Unreleased.
Completed items from the [backlog](docs/backlog-roadmap.md) move here.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed (the intro keeps its keys, and its music, 2026-09-05)

- **The title music could play on into the game.** `EliteMain`'s chart and
  status keys (F5-F11) were read on every screen, so a press on the intro
  moved the view straight off it. The intro screens own the title music and
  stop it in their own exit paths, which those keys never went through - so
  F5 then F1 launched the ship with the Elite theme still playing.
- **The intro screens now take only their own keys.** `HandleViewKeys`
  returns early on `IntroOne`/`IntroTwo`, which is what the F1 handler's own
  intro guard already said about the same screens; that guard is now
  redundant and gone. `HeadlessGameHarnessTests.ViewKeysDoNotLeaveTheIntro`
  covers F5, F9 and F11, and fails on each without the fix.

### Fixed (the scanner's stalk joins its ball again, 2026-09-05)

- **A lollipop could come apart.** `ScannerViewBase.UpdateScanner` drew the
  stick as a rectangle positioned at whichever end was higher and sized by
  `MathF.Abs(blipY - stickY)`. `DrawRectangleFilled` floors a position and a
  height *separately*, and `floor(a) + floor(d)` is a row short of
  `floor(a + d)` whenever the two fractions sum past a whole pixel - so a
  stick reaching up to its blip stopped one row below it, leaving a gap.
  Which frames showed it depended on where the ship happened to be, which is
  what made it look intermittent.
- **Both ends are floored before the difference is taken**, so the stick's
  last row is always the blip's first. `ScannerViewTests.StickReachesTheBlip`
  covers it, with the two "stick above the blip" cases that fail without the
  fix; the `launch-and-fly` frame signature was regenerated, its 32x32
  brightness grid unchanged - the difference is the one pixel.

### Changed (a ship is an id, not a member of an enum, 2026-08-31)

- **`ShipType` is gone.** It was the last thing keeping `ships.json` closed:
  a row had to name a member of an enum the game was compiled with, so no
  table could describe a ship nobody had built the game for. An object now
  carries the id the table files it under - `IObject.Id` - and the game
  recognises one by that. The four ships whose enum member and row id
  disagreed (`Cargo`/`CargoCannister`, `Hermit`/`RockHermit`,
  `Rock`/`RockSplinter`, `Dodec`/`DodecStation`) now have one name each.
- **The enum's numbering was carrying meaning, and that is the part that
  needed designing.** `> ShipType.Rock` meant "somebody is flying it";
  `> ShipType.None` and `< 0` meant "not the planet or the sun"; the
  mass-lock test named six pieces of junk to exclude. Those bands are
  `ShipTraits` now - `Crewed`, `MassLocks`, `Stellar` - stated by each row
  rather than implied by where a ship sat in a list.
- **Traits are deliberately not `ShipProperties`.** Flags are the ship's
  mood and are assigned wholesale in a dozen places: `FireMissile` does
  `missile.Flags = Angry`, which would wipe any fact about what the missile
  *is*. The test suite caught exactly that - two missile tests failed
  against a first attempt that put the traits in `Flags` - so a trait is set
  when the object is built and never again.
- **What the game still names by hand is in one place**, `ObjectIds`: the
  planet and the sun, the Thargoid a drone dies without, the two mission
  ships, and the wreckage a kill leaves. A table that omits one of those
  loses that behaviour rather than stopping the game.
- Two smaller things fell out. `Universe.IsStationPresent` asked whether a
  Coriolis or a Dodec was present; it asks whether the station slot holds
  something flagged as a station, so a table's own station counts.
  `CreateLoneWolf` parsed a mission's ship name into the enum to count what
  was flying - it counts by name now, and the parse is gone.
- Verified against the golden traces: all five scenarios and their frame
  signatures match the committed baselines **unchanged**, so the simulation
  and every rendered frame are identical to before. Full suite green (623 in
  `EliteSharpLib.Tests`).

### Changed (the ships are a table, not thirty-three classes, 2026-08-31)

- **Every ship in Elite was a class whose whole body was a constructor
  setting the same ten fields.** `Adder.cs` through `Worm.cs` declared no
  method, overrode nothing, and `ShipBase.Clone` had always returned a
  `ShipBase` whatever class it was called on - so the subclass was never
  anything the game could observe. The thirty-three files are now
  thirty-three rows in `src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/ships.json`, read by
  `ShipTable` into `ShipDefinition`s that `ShipFactory` builds its
  prototypes from. `ShipFactory`'s dictionary of thirty-three constructor
  lambdas, and the `s_modelNames` table of variants that borrow a parent's
  mesh, went with them.
- **The shape is the goods set's**, decided 2026-08-27: the file travels
  beside the assembly and is read from there, and nothing in the code knows
  the word "Adder". Not a plugin yet - a ship still needs a model in the
  rendition's asset manifest, so the table and the artwork have to agree -
  but the door is the one a plugin would come through.
- **A variant states only what it changes.** The two lone wolves were
  subclasses of the ship they vary (`CobraMk3Lone : CobraMk3`), so a row may
  name a `basedOn` and inherit every field it leaves unsaid, including which
  mesh to draw. That is also what keeps the asset manifest listing only real
  model files.
- **The file is checked when it is read**: a ship with no id, the same ship
  twice, a kind or a behaviour the game does not have, a `basedOn` naming a
  ship the file has not described. Each says which file and why, rather than
  starting a game with nothing to fly.
- Verified field by field against the deleted classes - all ten fields of
  all thirty-three ships, inherited variants and borrowed meshes included -
  match exactly. Full suite green (623 in `EliteSharpLib.Tests`, including
  eleven new `ShipTableTests`), and the ship parade still names and draws
  its ships in order.
- `ShipType` was still an enum at this point, so the table could not yet name
  a ship the game was not built against. The entry below closes that.

### Fixed (the integration-tests CI step failed on every run, 2026-08-31)

- **Only two of the thirteen test projects carry any `Level=Integration`
  test** - `EliteSharpLib.Tests` and `StuntCarRacerSharpLib.Tests`. Filtering
  the whole solution by that trait left the other eleven matching nothing,
  and the runner treats a project with zero matching tests as a failure
  (exit code 8) even though nothing is wrong. `dotnet test` reported the
  whole step failed although all 82 integration tests that exist had passed.
- `--ignore-exit-code 8` on that step's `dotnet test` call fixes it. A real
  test failure still exits non-zero (confirmed at 2, not 8) and still fails
  the build.
- The earlier local check that this step worked only read the printed
  `total`/`failed` summary, not the process's own exit code, which is how it
  passed review without the bug being seen.

### Removed (dead code the tests were propping up, 2026-08-31)

- **`MathsExtensions.GetRow` and `WithRow` could never be called.** .NET 10's
  `System.Numerics.Matrix4x4` has instance methods of both names, and an
  instance method beats an extension method, so all forty-odd call sites were
  already binding to the framework's. Mutating `GetRow` to return nonsense
  failed no test, which is how this came to light. Both are removed, and the
  solution builds unchanged - proof that nothing was calling them.
- The four `VectorMathsTests` that exercised them went with them. They were
  asserting the framework's behaviour, not the project's.
- `MathsExtensions.ToVector2` had no callers at all.
- `SharpKind.SDL.Tests` project-referenced `SharpKind.Input.Tests` and used
  nothing from it. A test project depending on another test project put
  `SharpKind.Input.Tests.exe` in the SDL project's output, where a runner
  could pick it up and run the input tests twice. It now references
  `SharpKind.Input` and `SharpKind.Fakes` directly, which is all it was
  getting through it.
- `SharpKind.SDL.Tests` and `SharpKind.Graphics.Tests` each carried a
  `global.json` selecting the test runner. A `global.json` is found by walking
  up from the working directory, so those only applied when `dotnet` was run
  from inside the project - an incomplete version of the fix now made once at
  the repository root.
- The eleven untracked `Useful.*` directories left behind by the SharpKind
  rename are deleted. Every file in them was byte-identical to its
  `SharpKind.*` counterpart once the rename was applied, so nothing was lost.

### Added (the player's own weapons are covered, 2026-08-31)

- `Combat`'s tests were all about what the AI does. Thirty tests now cover the
  player's side of it, taking the class from 54% of its lines to 61%.
- The missile is walked through its states: it will not arm with an empty
  rack, it locks onto the first ship in the crosshairs and not a later one,
  a ship outside the crosshairs is not locked onto, unarming forgets the lock,
  firing without a lock spends nothing, and firing with one spends the
  missile, angers the target and leaves the rack unarmed.
- The laser is covered as a decision table: each of the four views fires the
  laser on its own mount and a mount with no laser fires nothing; a screen
  that is not a view, a docked ship and an overheated laser each fire nothing;
  a shot that lands heats the laser and draws on the ship's energy.
- The armour rules are held: a station shrugs a laser off but takes offence,
  and the Constrictor and the Cougar are hurt only by a military laser.
- The ECM will not restart while one is running, someone else's ECM costs the
  player nothing, and docking puts every weapon back as it was found.

### Changed (the coverage figure stops counting the SDL bindings, 2026-08-31)

- `SharpKind.SDL` is out of the coverage denominator. It is the P/Invoke layer
  over SDL3, and every line of it needs a live window, audio device or
  gamepad, so 1434 lines that no test can reach were being counted as lines no
  test had reached. The figure said the game was less tested than it is.
- The parts of it that are not bindings are tested rather than excused. The
  key table is now covered key by key - every letter, digit and function key -
  because a case left out of the switch falls through to `ConsoleKey.None`,
  which is exactly the fault the arrow-key regression already recorded there.
  Both control keys are asserted to be a modifier and not a key.
- `SaveState`'s copy constructor is covered by reflecting over the class's own
  properties, so a property added to a save and forgotten in the copy fails
  the test without the test being touched.
- Line coverage is 89.5% and branch coverage 78.7%.

### Added (both renditions draw every screen in a test, 2026-08-31)

- **Nothing had ever drawn an 8-bit screen.** The tier sat at 0.5% of its
  lines while the 16-bit tier was at 67%, and the difference was not that one
  was tested: the 16-bit tier is the one the golden traces and the headless
  harness happen to load, so it was covered by accident and the other was
  covered not at all.
- `RenditionViewTests` draws all sixteen screens of both renditions from one
  table of filled-in models. The 8-bit tier goes to 67% and the 16-bit tier to
  96%.
- The palette is the real one off disk, which is what makes this worth
  running: a view naming a colour its own tier's palette does not define
  throws, and nothing else would have caught it.
- One test compares the table against the rendition's own set of screens, so a
  screen added to a rendition and not added here fails rather than quietly
  going undrawn.

### Added (buying equipment is covered, 2026-08-31)

- The equip-ship screen was at 53% of its lines: the list and its tech-level
  gating were held, but almost nothing about buying was. 34 more tests take it
  to 98%.
- One case of the buy switch per row, as a decision table: each fits its own
  piece of equipment, takes its own price, and stops offering itself
  afterwards. Fuel and missiles are separate, because they are capped rather
  than owned - the tank fills to seven at two credits a light year, and the
  fourth missile is the last.
- All sixteen laser-and-mount combinations are covered, each asserting the
  laser lands on that mount and on no other, and all four trade-in values are
  asserted by fitting a laser over one already there.
- A purchase with too few credits changes nothing, the cursor keys are
  asserted with their aliases, and the cursor is asserted to stop at both ends
  of the list.

### Added (the game over screen is covered, 2026-08-31)

- The game over screen was at 41% of its lines. Nine tests take it to 96%.
- What `Reset` builds is held: the wreck and five pieces of cargo, all at the
  same distance, only the wreck already dead, the cargo scattered and spinning,
  the player's roll and pitch stopped and the drift speed set, and the effect
  played once.
- The hundred-tick wait is asserted on both sides of its boundary, and again
  at four times the frame rate, where it must take four times as many updates.
  The clock is opened per update the way `EliteMain`'s loop opens it, so the
  screen is told what fraction of a tick each update is worth.
- The two `AddNewShip` failure branches are left uncovered: `Reset` clears the
  universe first, so neither can be reached.

### Added (the short range chart is covered, 2026-08-31)

- **The short range chart had the thinnest cover of any screen: 12% of its
  lines.** It is also the only controller that works in screen space, so the
  cross-hair's box comes from the tier's layout rather than from the galaxy,
  and none of that was held by a test.
- 25 tests take it to 100%. The cross-hair's four edges are asserted at the
  boundary rather than near it, each direction key is asserted with its alias
  (S and Up, X and Down, comma and Left, full stop and Right), and the 8-bit
  tier is asserted to be the 16-bit one halved, which is the claim that lets
  one controller serve both.
- The find prompt is walked through its states: opened, typed into,
  backspaced (including backspacing an empty name, which must not underflow),
  and closed on a name that exists and on one that does not.
- The five-update delay on the distance readout is covered from both sides: it
  does not report early while the player is still moving, and an untouched
  chart does not re-measure at all.

### Changed (the frame-rate tests play the game four times, not fourteen, 2026-08-31)

- Each of the seven `FrameRateIndependenceTests` started its own pair of game
  runs, so the class played the game fourteen times for eight distinct runs.
  The runs now live in a `FrameRateRuns` class fixture, built once for the
  class.
- Two of the runs went away entirely. The throttle tests stopped part way up a
  ramp that the longer runs pass through anyway, so a run records the speed as
  it goes by instead: the flight pair also serves the player's throttle test,
  and the docking pair serves both halves of the autopilot's. Four runs cover
  all seven tests.
- The class takes 4.3 seconds rather than 9.4, and `EliteSharpLib.Tests` as a
  whole takes 4.1 rather than 8.8. Nothing is asserted that was not asserted
  before: a sample read at update 108 of a run that continues to 175 is the
  same state a run that stopped at 108 ended in.
- Both branches of `Pilot.ApplyAutoDockSpeed` were reverted in turn again, as
  they were when the tests were written. The wind-down test still fails alone
  for the deceleration branch and the wind-up test alone for the other, so the
  shared runs have not blunted them.

### Added (the tests are split into two levels, 2026-08-31)

- Fifteen test classes now carry `[Trait("Level", "Integration")]`. They drive
  the real DI composition, the headless game harness, the file system or a
  plugin loaded off disk, so they test components together rather than one
  component on its own. Everything else stays unmarked and is a unit test.
- The unit level is 1580 tests in 3.3 seconds, so it can be run on every save.
  The integration level is the other 74 tests and takes 9.3 seconds by itself.
- The build runs the two as separate steps, unit level first, so a broken unit
  test is named before the slow level runs at all. Both steps collect coverage
  into the same folder and the report merges them, so the badge still covers
  the whole suite.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` says which level a new test belongs at.

### Fixed (coverage is measured again, 2026-08-31)

- **The coverage figure came from a collector that no longer ran.**
  `coverlet.collector` is a VSTest data collector, so it collected nothing
  once the tests moved to the Microsoft.Testing.Platform runner. The test
  projects now reference `Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.CodeCoverage`, set in
  `Directory.Build.props` beside the runner it belongs to.
- The build asks for one cobertura file per test project rather than one
  merged file. The collector's own merge counts a line once for every project
  that loaded the assembly, and reports the lowest run instead of the union:
  it put `SharpKind.Input` at 0% and `SharpKind.Graphics` at 55.5% when the
  figures are 95.7% and 94.5%. ReportGenerator merges the separate files
  correctly.
- The badge reads 77.8%, the first figure the tests have actually earned.
  Line coverage is 14195 of 18236; branch coverage is 67.8%.

### Fixed (the test suite runs again on CI, 2026-08-31)

- **`dotnet test` ran no tests at all.** `xunit.v3` marks a project as a
  Microsoft.Testing.Platform application, and the VSTest-based `dotnet test`
  skips those without a word. The only two projects it did pick up were
  `EliteSharpLib.Fakes` and `StuntCarRacerSharpLib.Fakes`, which hold no
  tests, so the build's test step passed vacuously and a red test could not
  break it. All 1654 tests now run.
- `dotnet.config` selects the Microsoft.Testing.Platform runner for the .NET
  10 SDK, and `global.json` does the same for the .NET 11 SDK, which moved
  the setting. Both are needed while the two SDKs are in use side by side.
- The runner is set once, in `Directory.Build.props`, for every project whose
  name ends in `.Tests`. Ten of the thirteen set it themselves and three did
  not, which is the kind of gap that made the step silent in the first place.
- The two Fakes projects no longer reference `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`, `Moq`
  or `coverlet.collector`. They are fake implementations, not test projects,
  and the reference is what made the runner treat them as one. The other two
  Fakes projects never had it.
- The coverage badge the build publishes was measured from those same two
  empty projects, so it has been reporting a figure no test earned.

### Added (the docking computer's throttle ramp is covered, 2026-08-31)

- **`Pilot.ApplyAutoDockSpeed`'s rate scaling was untested.** The autopilot
  nudges the player's throttle a step every update, so the frame-rate rework
  scaled it like everything else, but the first attempt at a test passed with
  the fix reverted and was removed rather than left giving false assurance:
  the ramp saturates at both ends, and it sampled the computer sitting at its
  22 ceiling, where a rate four times too fast is invisible.
- Two tests in `FrameRateIndependenceTests` now catch it, both sampling the
  ramp while it is still moving. The computer is engaged at full speed
  pointing away from the station, so it winds the throttle down first and
  accelerates once it has turned around; one test stops part way down, the
  other part way up. Each of `ApplyAutoDockSpeed`'s two branches was reverted
  in turn to confirm which test covers it - the wind-down test alone passes
  with the accelerating branch unscaled, which is why there are two.
- The harness fits the docking computer mid-run, after the script's 'N' has
  made the new commander that does not come with one.

### Fixed (a commander loads whatever case the name is typed in, 2026-08-29)

- **A save was unreachable on Linux unless its file name was already upper
  case.** Letters reach the load and save screens as `ConsoleKey` values, so a
  typed name is always upper case, but the file was written under whatever case
  the name was given in. Windows treats the two as one file and macOS usually
  does; Linux does not, so a save sitting plainly in the folder answered "No
  Such Commander". Save paths are now upper-cased with `ToUpperInvariant`, which
  is a no-op for every name the game itself makes and rescues hand-edited and
  older files. Two cases of one name are now one commander, not two saves.
- The tests that missed it spelled the save path out a second time instead of
  asking the game for it, so they were free to disagree with it about case -
  and on Windows nothing ever said so. `SaveFile.PathFor` is internal now and
  every test goes through it, including the load-screen test, which takes the
  commander name from the keys it pressed rather than writing it out again.
- `scripts/test-case-sensitive.ps1` runs the suite against a case-sensitive
  temporary directory on Windows, so this class of difference is found before
  the push rather than by CI. It needs the WSL optional component, which is
  what provides the per-directory flag, and no elevation.
- Tests that set an environment variable now do it through an
  `EnvironmentVariableScope` that puts the previous value back. The variable
  belongs to the process rather than the test, and xUnit runs test classes in
  parallel, so one left behind changes the answer for whoever reads it next.

### Fixed (a rejected commander file says which field, 2026-08-27)

- **Loading a save said only "Error Loading Commander!", whichever of a dozen
  checks it failed**, and the log said only which path it was. A commander
  whose file was one field wrong could not tell that from a file that was
  never a save. The screen now names the field - "Bad Fuel", "Bad Cargo",
  "Bad Missions" - and the log carries the value and what was expected
  alongside it: *fuel 99 is outside 0..7*, *nothing is listed for 'Furs'*.
- The one boolean `&&` chain became one named check per rule, chained with
  `??` so the first failure wins and reports itself. A save written against
  a different goods set now says which good is missing, which is what tells
  a commander it is the wrong economy rather than a corrupt file.
- `SaveNamesUnknownMission` and `SaveNamesUnknownStage` are gone: their
  content is the problem's own detail now, so it travels to the screen
  instead of only to the log.

### Fixed (a brief key press on SCR's track preview did nothing, 2026-08-27)

- **`TrackPreviewScreen` read its keys inside the physics gate**, which runs
  one tick in four, so `IsPressed` - a one-shot read - missed any press
  landing on the other three. A quick tap of `S` or `M` there did nothing,
  while the same tap worked on every other screen. The keys are read every
  tick now, before the gate; the physics cadence is unchanged and pinned by
  a test.
- The defect was known and worked around rather than fixed: the test
  helper held `S` down for four ticks with the comment "hold S until a
  physics tick reads it". It is one press now, which is the proof.

### Changed (the classic goods are a file, 2026-08-27)

- **`ClassicGoodsSet` reads `goods.json` instead of hardcoding seventeen
  wares.** The file ships beside the assembly and is read from there, the
  way a rendition reads the artwork it brought with it. The class is only
  what finds and checks it: nothing in the plugin's code knows the word
  "Food" any more, and the set's own name comes from the file too - so a
  different economy is a different JSON beside the same DLL, with no
  compiler involved.
- With the plugin assembly as the door and the file as the table, the
  2026-08-02 missions entry's "inert content is a config-shaped problem"
  turns out to have been right about the shape and wrong only about it
  being a choice between the two. See [decisions.md](docs/decisions.md).
- **A bad table stops the game and says which file and why.** Missing,
  unparseable, describing no goods, naming no set, or a good with a blank
  id, name or unit - each throws with the path, and the JSON reader's own
  line and position come through for a parse error. Duplicate ids and the
  goods a wrecked ship drops stay `GoodsRegistry`'s checks, since those
  depend on what else is installed.
- The opening station stock was written in hex after the original (`0x10`,
  `0x3A`); JSON has none, so the file carries 16 and 58. The values are
  unchanged and pinned by test.
- The market drawn from the file differs from the market drawn from the
  literal in zero pixels. `EliteSharp.Goods.TestPlugin` deliberately keeps
  building its goods in C#, so `IGoodsSet` stays demonstrably implementable
  either way.

### Fixed (the inventory no longer runs off the screen, 2026-08-27)

- **A hold with more sorts of thing in it than the screen had rows for drew
  into the HUD and then off the bottom.** `InventoryView8Bit` started its
  cargo list at row 7 of a twenty-five-row viewport and drew one row per
  good carried, with nothing stopping it; the wares past the eighteenth
  were simply lost, and the eighteenth was cut in half by the scanner.
  Reachable as soon as a goods set larger than the classic seventeen is
  installed, which the goods plugin now allows.
- The screen is built from `ListView<TableRow>` like the market, with an
  `InventoryListStyle` per rendition declaring how many rows fit (17 at
  8-bit, computed from the viewport at 16-bit). It scrolls past that.
- **The list shows no cursor.** Nothing on this screen can be chosen, so
  `ListView.ShowCursor` is off: the cursor still exists, because something
  has to decide which way the window moves, but drawing it would offer a
  choice the screen does not have.
- **A trade keeps the commander's place.** `ListView.SetRows` replaces the
  rows while keeping the cursor where the new list allows, so selling
  something out of a scrolled list does not jump back to the top -
  the reason it is not `Clear` followed by `Add`.
- Unchanged for the classic seventeen, pixel for pixel: a capture of the
  rebuilt screen differs from one taken before the rewrite in zero pixels.
- `InventoryController` had no tests; it has six now.

### Changed (the market scrolls, 2026-08-27)

- **`ListView<TControl>` and `TableRow` join `SharpKind.UI`.** A list view
  owns a cursor and a window onto however many rows fit, and scrolls to
  follow the one from the other; a table row is several cells anchored at
  fixed columns sharing one highlight block. A list shorter than its window
  never scrolls, which is what lets a screen that drew a fixed number of
  rows keep drawing them exactly where it did.
- **The market screen is built from those controls.** `MarketView8Bit` and
  `MarketView16Bit` are deleted, and `MarketModel`/`MarketRow` with them; a
  rendition supplies a `MarketListStyle` - colours, column offsets,
  headings and a visible-row count - the way it already supplies a
  `SettingsListStyle`. This deliberately narrows the 2026-08-03 "a
  rendition draws everything" decision for this one screen; see
  [decisions.md](docs/decisions.md).
- **A goods set larger than the screen can now be traded.** The 8-bit
  market had a hard seventeen-row budget - first row at 5, cash line at 23
  - so an eighteenth good drew over the cash. That number is the
  rendition's declared `VisibleRows` now (17 at 8-bit, 19 at 16-bit) and
  the list scrolls past it. Verified live with a 25-ware set: seventeen
  rows shown, cash line intact, and the window following the cursor to the
  last ware.
- **The classic market is unchanged, pixel for pixel.** A capture of the
  rebuilt screen differs from one taken before the rewrite in zero pixels
  across the whole list area.

### Changed (goods are a plugin, 2026-08-27)

- **`StockType` is gone; a goods set is an assembly.** `IGoodsSet` joins
  `EliteSharp.Abstractions.Trading`, and the seventeen classic wares ship
  as `EliteSharp.Goods.Classic`, found in a `Goods` folder beside the
  executable through the same MEF door as the missions and renditions. A
  different economy is now an assembly, not an edit.
- **Missing is fatal, like a rendition.** No `Goods` folder, an empty one,
  or two sets in it all stop the game at startup with a message that names
  the folder - there is no market without exactly one set. `GoodsRegistry`
  then checks the chosen set at startup: it throws, listing names, if the
  set repeats or blanks an id, or leaves out one of the four goods a
  wrecked ship drops (`ScoopableGoods.Required`).
- **The classic economy is byte-identical.** Prices, quantities, the
  opening station shelf, the contraband weights and the canister-loot draw
  all came out of four hardcoded places and into one `ClassicGoodsSet`
  declaration; the golden-trace baselines did not move, and
  `ClassicGoodsTests` pins what the old enum ordinals and side-lists said.
- Saves are unchanged. `SaveFile.IsValidStock` already turned away a
  `.cmdr` whose goods do not match the live set exactly, so a file from a
  different economy is rejected with no new field and no version bump.
- `AddRenditionAssets` moved to its own extension class to keep
  `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions` under the class-coupling limit - the
  same split the screen registrations already use.

### Fixed (a failure to start now says so, 2026-08-27)

- **The composition moved inside the try/catch.** `GameApp.Run` only ever
  guarded `game.Run()`, so everything `buildServices` does - loading the
  configured rendition, its assets, the mission plugins - unwound through
  `Main` as a raw stack trace. Started from a shortcut rather than a
  terminal that was a window which never appeared and no explanation
  anywhere. A test pins it: a `buildServices` that throws now returns -1 and
  reports, and it fails against the old arrangement.
- **A failure reaches the player, not just the console.**
  `AppStartup.WriteFailureHint` wrote to stderr, which a double-clicked app
  has nowhere to show. `SDLMessageBox.ShowError` puts the same text in a
  dialog - SDL's simple message box works before `SDL_Init` and without a
  window, which is exactly the ground a startup failure covers. It is passed
  in rather than called directly so a test can watch what a failure reports
  without opening a real dialog nobody is there to dismiss.
- **The message names the cause.** `AppStartup.DescribeFailure` is the one
  account both channels read from, and it now carries the exception's own
  message: a bad rendition reports "Nothing in ...\Renditions is called
  '8-bot', so there is nothing to draw the game with" rather than
  "Application terminated unexpectedly". A missing native library keeps its
  own wording, being the one failure whose message helps nobody.
- **The startup diagnostics are logged before the composition**, so a
  failure to compose leaves behind which build and which settings were being
  tried. They used to be written after it, and went down with it.
- `SharpKind.App` had no tests; it has some now. Both games and the control
  gallery share `GameApp`, so all three were smoke-tested live.

### Fixed (Elite: the last two rate couplings, 2026-08-26)

- **The starfield drew from the game's random stream.** Where a recycled star
  reappears decides nothing - the stars are scenery - but taking those
  numbers from the game's stream meant the game's *other* rolls depended on
  how many updates had gone by, because a star is recycled when it leaves the
  view and that is tested once per update. The same twenty seconds at two
  rates could then meet different ships, which is what the cross-rate test
  found: a Transporter at 13.5Hz, nothing at 60Hz. It moves to
  `RenderRandom`, reached through `IEliteDraw.Jitter`, which `Stars` already
  had - the constructor loses a parameter rather than gaining one.
- **Both rates now meet the same ships**, and that is a test rather than a
  claim. Encounters are rolled on the housekeeping clock, so the same seconds
  roll the same dice, and nothing draws from the stream once per update in
  between any more.
- **An E.C.M. burst is counted in ticks.** `TimeECM` ran down once per
  update, so a burst that should last thirty-two ticks lasted a quarter as
  long at sixty frames a second, and cost a quarter of the energy with it. It
  was missed because no golden scenario arms a missile, so nothing ever ran
  the code - hence two tests that reach it directly.
- The two baselines part company over the starfield change. Traces record
  state and keep an **unseeded** render stream, which is what makes their
  reproducibility test mean something; frames record pixels and now need it
  pinned, because the starfield is scattered from it. Both regenerated - the
  `long-flight` encounter is a Shuttle where it was a Transporter, which is
  the coupling coming out.

### Changed (Elite runs at the configured frame rate, 2026-08-26)

- **One rate for both halves.** `GameTickRate` is gone: `Update` and `Draw`
  both run at `Config.Fps`, and how much game time an update is worth is read
  from that rather than fixed at 13.5Hz. The five conversions before this are
  what make it safe.
- **The cross-rate test found a real gap in the motion item**, and nothing
  else could have. The player does not move in Elite; the universe moves
  past. Besides each ship's own velocity, three more terms carry the player -
  the speed sliding everything towards the camera, and the roll and pitch
  shearing every object's position and orientation - and all three were still
  per update, in `Space` and again in the starfield. At 60Hz the player flew
  four and a half times too fast and was dead inside twenty seconds. Scaled,
  the same twenty-two seconds at either rate end on the same screen, within
  one housekeeping step, with the planet half a percent apart.
- **The input cadence the backlog worried about does not arise.**
  `IsPressed` consumes on read, so it returns true once per `KeyDown` the OS
  sends rather than once per poll; polling faster cannot manufacture presses.
  If anything the faster poll loses fewer OS repeats, because `SDLInput`
  drains the whole queue per update and a slower one can coalesce two
  presses into one.
- The traces and frames still run at the game's own rate and are still
  bit-identical - the harness pins `Fps` to 13.5, so a step is a tick and the
  baselines keep meaning what they meant. Whether the game plays the same at
  another rate is a different question, and `FrameRateIndependenceTests` is
  now a real answer to it.
- **Two known gaps recorded rather than quietly left**: the starfield
  recycles stars out of the game's random stream, so encounters can differ
  between rates; and `Combat.TimeECM` still counts down per update. Both are
  in [backlog-roadmap.md](docs/backlog-roadmap.md).

### Changed (Elite's animations run on time, 2026-08-26)

- **Everything that counted updates now counts time**: the laser's
  temperature and its reload counter, the info message's dwell, the break
  pattern's twenty rings, the game-over hold, the escape-capsule sequence and
  the ship it leaves behind, both intro screens, and the explosion cloud.
- **One new trap, the mirror of the spin peg.** The capsule's abandoned ship
  blew up on the tick that *equalled* forty. A whole tick lands on forty
  exactly; a third of one steps from just under to just over and never lands,
  leaving the ship to fly on intact. It is a crossing test now. Anything of
  the shape `tick == N` has the same problem.
- **`SfxSample` is shared with Stunt Car Racer**, which counts sample
  lifetimes in whole updates and says nothing about time. `UpdateSound` has
  two overloads rather than an optional argument: SCR calls the one meaning
  "a whole tick" and is untouched by construction, and the test that already
  covered that path still passes unchanged.
- `MessageCount` and `ExpDelta` became floats, so the trace format moves to
  v3 and the baselines are regenerated. Every value is unchanged - only the
  printing of two columns - checked against the committed files rather than
  assumed. The frame signatures were **not** regenerated and still pass, so
  every pixel is identical too.
- `CoolLaser` moved to a `Combat.Laser` partial: the conversion took the file
  past the enforced length, and the two things it counts down belong
  together.

### Changed (Elite's ships think on the clock, 2026-08-26)

- **A ship now thinks once per count rather than once per update.** Combat
  spread its thinking across the universe slots by phase - a ship runs its
  tactics on the counts whose low three bits match its slot - so one slot in
  eight thinks per count and no two in the same eight think together. That is
  kept exactly. What the phase test can no longer do alone is stay *once*:
  the count moves 13.5 times a second whatever the update rate, so at a
  faster rate it stays true for several updates together and a ship would
  think four or five times where it thought once.
- `TacticsSchedule` remembers the count each slot last thought on and refuses
  a repeat within it. It cannot hold a ship back - a slot's next matching
  count is eight on, and the same value only returns after a full turn of the
  counter, by which time that slot has thought on thirty-one other counts. It
  is cleared with the universe, since a slot outlives the ship in it.
- Its own type rather than three more fields on `Combat`, which was already
  at the enforced file-length limit - and the rule reads better named than as
  a bit test in the middle of a tactics routine.
- **`MCount` survives.** The backlog expected this item to remove it; it
  should not. The count is the shared phase every housekeeping job hangs off
  and the one `Space.JumpWarp` re-phases by masking to six bits. What changed
  is what paces it, not whether it exists.
- Traces and frames bit-identical again; `TacticsScheduleTests` covers what
  they cannot, including the five-thoughts-instead-of-one failure the refusal
  exists to prevent.

### Changed (Elite runs on a clock, 2026-08-26)

- **The housekeeping is paced in seconds.** Elite hung six jobs off its
  `MCount` counter - the hyperspace countdown, shield regeneration, altitude,
  cabin temperature, the encounter roll and the docking-computer reminder.
  The counter is a clock rather than a tally: its jobs are spread across it
  by residue, and `Space.JumpWarp` re-phases the whole set at once by masking
  the count to six bits. Give each job a timer of its own and that is gone,
  so the count survives and `GameClock` decides how often it moves - one step
  per update at 13.5Hz, and still 13.5 steps a second at any other rate.
- The reminder moved onto the clock from beside the autopilot, which still
  steers every update. Where it was, it would have fired on every frame the
  count happened to sit on a multiple of 128 - once at 13.5Hz, four or five
  times at sixty.
- **Motion is a speed rather than a step.** Ship velocity, the small-angle
  rotation, the spin winding down, the player's roll and pitch, and the
  starfield delta all scale by `GameClock.Ticks`.
- **Two byte-domain edges needed real float equivalents.** A spin pegged at
  the limit does not wind down, and that test was an exact match against 127,
  which only holds while the rate arrives in whole units; it is against the
  magnitude now. And the spin decay and `LevelOut` clamp at zero rather than
  stepping past it - a whole tick could never overshoot, a fraction of one
  can, and a ship levelling out by jittering either side of centre would be
  the frame rate showing through.
- **Float ordering turned out to matter.** `RotateXFirst` divides first and
  scales second, because a nineteenth is not exactly representable and
  folding `ticks` into the divisor moves the result even at one tick. The
  frame check caught that on the intro parade before it could be committed.
- **The clock hangs off `GameState`**, beside the `MCount` it drives: the
  count's unspent time and how much of a tick an update is worth are state of
  the running game like everything else there, and everything needing the
  clock already had the state.
- **All five traces and all five frame checks stayed bit-identical.** These
  were arranged to be no-ops at the game's own rate rather than
  approximations of it, so the tolerance is still zero. What only shows at
  another rate is covered directly instead: `GameClockTests` (600 updates at
  60Hz and 300 at 30Hz each buy exactly 135 steps) and
  `RateIndependentMotionTests` (two half-ticks roll as far as one whole
  tick). The reminder has its own test because no trace flies with the
  autopilot - Commander Jameson has no docking computer to engage.

### Changed (Elite simulates and composes separately, 2026-08-26)

- **`EliteMain.Update` is now `Simulate` then `Compose`** - everything the
  tick changes, then everything it draws - with the frame built in the same
  order as before: the starfield behind the universe, the universe behind
  the view's chrome, the console across all of it.
- `Space.UpdateUniverse` became `MoveUniverse` and `DrawUniverse`. They
  share the view-space clones: the game works out where everything is and
  what it looks like from here, and the frame is painted from that. A clone
  is a snapshot, so drawing it later cannot see a position the tick has
  since changed.
- `Stars`' four passes now only move the stars and collect their marks;
  `Stars.Draw` hands them to the rendition and empties the list as it goes,
  which is what makes it safe to call on every screen - one with no
  starfield draws nothing rather than repainting the last cockpit view's.
- **Two orderings had to be recorded rather than rediscovered**, and that is
  why `EliteMain` grew two fields. The hyperspace countdown is drawn before
  it is decremented; the info message is the one already on screen, not the
  "ENERGY LOW" the same method may raise a few lines later. Both are true
  only in the middle of a tick, so the tick records them and `Compose`
  paints them.
- Input stays a third phase after `Compose`, where this port has always read
  it. Moving it earlier would show a screen change a tick sooner than it
  does today; which phase it belongs to is the frame-rate list's last item.
- **All five traces and all five frame checks are identical** - the state is
  unchanged and so is every pixel, which is what a refactor of the drawing
  should be able to claim.

### Added (Elite frame check, 2026-08-26)

- **The golden traces compare state and cannot see the order things are
  drawn in.** That is the risk in the rest of the simulate/compose split:
  the starfield is drawn before the universe today, and moving it into a
  compose pass without preserving that would paint the stars over the ships
  with every trace still green. `VisualDumpTests` writes BMPs for a human to
  look at and asserts nothing, so nothing else covered it either.
- Twelve frames across the five scenarios are now signed and committed.
  `HeadlessGameHarnessBase` gained `CaptureFrame()` (`SaveFrame` is now one
  line on top of it), and `TraceScenario` gained the ticks to capture.
- **Signed twice over, because one alone is not enough.** An exact SHA-256
  of every pixel catches any change at all; a 32x32 brightness grid shows
  *where* it changed. The grid is the half a reviewer reads - the repo has
  no image diff and no PNG writer, so without it a failure would be a
  changed hex string and nothing else. On failure the two grids print side
  by side with the differing rows marked.
- The ramp is square-rooted rather than linear. Elite draws thin bright
  lines on black, so a cell holding a break-pattern arc or a dozen stars
  averages about eight out of 255 and would round to "empty" on a linear
  ramp - exactly the content worth seeing. Curved, the break pattern's
  concentric rings, the viewport border and the HUD band all read.
- **Verified by breaking it on purpose.** Moving the view's chrome to draw
  before the universe - a change to pixels only, touching no state - left
  all five traces green and failed four of the five frame checks, with the
  differing rows landing exactly where the "Front View" header had been
  covered by the planet. Whole suite: 1543 tests.

### Changed (Elite: the drawing stops touching the game, 2026-08-26)

- **The explosion left the renderer.** `EliteDraw.DrawObject` seeded
  `ExpDelta` at 18 and `DrawExplosion` advanced it by four and flagged the
  wreck for removal - game state changed from inside the draw path, so a
  cloud aged once per drawn frame rather than once per tick.
  `Space.AgeExplosion` owns the lifecycle now and runs where the draw call
  used to, so the sequence is unchanged: lit at 18, immediately aged to 22 -
  the first size ever drawn - then four a tick until past 251. The screen
  test the renderer applied is now `GameState.ShowsUniverse`, derived and
  shared, because a wreck must not burn down behind a chart screen. All five
  golden traces stayed identical at zero tolerance.
- **The drawing has its own random stream, and this one changes
  behaviour.** Composition drew from the simulation's `RNG`, and
  view-dependently: `ShipBase.DrawLasers` returns before its two draws when
  the laser mount faces away, `DrawExplosionParticles` scatters sixteen
  blocks around each *visible* projected point, and `DrawObject` returns
  early off-screen. So what was on screen decided what happened next -
  turning the camera away from an explosion changed which ships arrived
  later. Beyond being wrong on its own, it blocks the frame-rate goal: once
  Elite composes at a rate of its own, drawing more often would move the
  simulation.
- `RenderRandom` is that stream - a distinct type rather than a second `RNG`
  registration, so the two cannot be swapped at a constructor. It rides on
  `IEliteDraw.Jitter`, which is where the entropy belongs and which let
  **every ship constructor drop its `rng` parameter**, thirty-seven files
  simpler. `ShipFactory` keeps the game's `RNG` for its own rolls - whether
  an asteroid is really a Rock Hermit - and hands ships nothing.
- **The baselines were regenerated for this**: encounters now arrive on
  different ticks, and that diff is the coupling being removed. It is the
  one time the frame-rate work changes behaviour for a reason other than the
  rate. Pre-rolling the cosmetic values in the simulate pass would have kept
  them byte-identical and was rejected as self-defeating - how many rolls
  happen depends on visibility, decided during projection, which is the work
  being separated.
- The harness now seeds the game's RNG and deliberately leaves
  `RenderRandom` unseeded, so if drawing ever influences the simulation
  again the reproducibility test starts failing at random rather than the
  coupling going unnoticed. `FakeEliteDraw` supplies no jitter at all, so a
  test asserting where a laser bolt lands gets the geometry.

### Added (Elite golden-trace harness, 2026-08-26)

- **The frame-rate rework needed a regression net before it could start.**
  Elite's simulation is about to have roughly two dozen per-tick rates and
  counters converted to per-second ones (see
  [backlog-roadmap.md](docs/backlog-roadmap.md)), and nothing existed that
  could say whether a conversion had changed the game. Five scripted
  scenarios - the title parade, a launch and flight, a long flight, holding
  the trigger down, and a kill - now run against the real `EliteMain`
  through
  `HeadlessGameHarness` and record the game state after every tick to
  committed baselines under
  `src/elite/test/EliteSharpLib.Tests/GoldenTrace`.
- **They characterise, they do not judge.** A trace records what the game
  does, not what it should do; a baseline changing is a prompt to explain
  why, not automatically a bug. `ELITE_REGENERATE_TRACES=1` rewrites them
  and deliberately fails the run, so a regenerated baseline cannot reach a
  commit unnoticed.
- **Not a rendered frame.** The comparison is state - screen, docked and
  game-over flags, `MCount`, message count, laser temperature, roll, climb,
  speed, energy, shields, fuel, cabin temperature, altitude, and every
  universe slot's type, position, spin, flags and explosion age. The rate
  items change
  *when* things happen, not what they look like, so a pixel comparison
  would fail for reasons that have nothing to do with them. There is no
  player position because Elite has none: the ship sits at the origin and
  the universe moves past it.
- **The explosion cloud is traced because the renderer owns it.**
  `EliteDraw.DrawObject` seeds `ExpDelta` at 18 and `DrawExplosion` advances
  it by four every drawn frame, setting `Remove` past 251 - game state
  changed from inside the draw path, and the clearest thing separating
  simulate from compose has to move. The `explosion` scenario holds the
  trigger down until an encounter flies into the beam: at the committed seed
  a Transporter dies around tick 270, the cloud ramps 22 to 254 over sixty
  ticks, and the slot empties at 330. The kill is not aimed, because it
  cannot be - the escape capsule and the energy bomb are the game's two
  deterministic explosions and both belong to Commander Max, who is
  deliberately turned off here.
- **Numbers compare with a tolerance, discrete fields never do.** The
  tolerance is zero today and rises when the rate conversion makes exact
  arithmetic impossible; a screen, a ship type or a flag set that differs
  means the run took another path, which is a regression however small the
  numbers are. Both sides are compared as stored: the file keeps four
  decimals, which for a coordinate in the thousands is finer than a
  `float`'s own resolution, so reading one back does not land on the bits
  that were written.
- **Two things had to be pinned before a trace could be reproducible.**
  `HeadlessGameHarness` gained an optional seed that replaces the app's
  `Random.Shared`. And `ELITE_DEBUG_COMMANDER` - read in `SaveFile`'s
  constructor, and set on at least one developer machine - swaps Commander
  Jameson for a fully equipped Max, whose stronger front laser changes the
  firing cadence: the first baselines silently recorded the debug
  commander, and `SaveFileTests` clearing the variable mid-run was what
  exposed it. `TraceRecorder` now clears it too, so a trace records the
  commander the game ships with rather than the one the machine asks for.
- Test-only: no game code changed.

### Added (Gamepad and joystick support, 2026-08-22)

- **Neither game could be played with anything but a keyboard.** A new
  `IGamepad`/`IGamepadSink` pair in `SharpKind.Input` mirrors the
  `IKeyboard`/`IKeyboardSink` split, keeping the same pressed-vs-held
  semantics: one-shot reads for menu actions, non-consuming reads for
  controls polled every tick. Axes are floats, so an XInput-style pad keeps
  its travel and a generic HID stick reports -1/0/+1 through the same
  interface. Unplugging the last device clears held state, so a button held
  as the cable comes out cannot stay held forever.
- `SDLInput` initialises the SDL3 gamepad and joystick subsystems and
  handles hotplug for both. A device with a gamepad mapping is opened as a
  gamepad and its buttons arrive named; one without a mapping is opened as
  a raw joystick, where index order is the only mapping there is. A hat
  feeds the left stick axes, so an 8-way stick reads the same either way.
  A device that appears in both event streams is only opened once.
- **A pad that "does nothing" is a mapping question the game cannot answer
  from its own side**, so each device's name and its axis, button and hat
  counts are logged when it connects, and every button, axis and hat event
  is logged at `Debug`. Turn it on with `SCR_LOG_LEVEL=Debug` or
  `ELITE_LOG_LEVEL=Debug` and the log says which physical control is which
  index.
- **Stunt Car Racer drives from a pad or a joystick.** A pad follows
  ptitSeb's remake (`Car_Behaviour.cpp:793-817`): right trigger
  accelerates, (B) or left trigger brakes and wins over accelerate, the
  left stick steers. A one-stick joystick has no triggers, so it drives the
  arcade way instead - forward accelerates, back brakes - and boosts on
  buttons 1 or 3. Both layouts are read at once, since neither device can
  reach the other's controls. Steering is thresholded to the digital
  left/right the physics expects, and the pad is only read when the
  keyboard is idle, as the remake does, so keyboard driving is untouched.
  Buttons 1 and 2 navigate the menu, preview and game-over screens, the
  stick steps through the track list, Start toggles the race pause and Back
  abandons the race. The preview screen lists the controls while a device
  is attached.
- **Elite flies from the same stick:** roll and pitch on the axes, fire on
  buttons 1 or 3, speed up and down on 2 and 4 (or the triggers). Fire sits
  on the same pair as Stunt Car Racer's boost, so one stick behaves the
  same way in both games. Docking, hyperspace, missiles, ECM, the charts
  and the trading screens have no room on one stick and stay on the
  keyboard.
- Smoke-tested with a USB Competition Pro Extra, which is what moved fire
  and boost onto buttons 1 and 3. An XInput pad is still unconfirmed - see
  the remaining backlog item.

### Added (Alpha blending, 2026-08-22)

- **Neither backend had transparency of any kind.** A colour's alpha was
  carried around and then thrown away at the point it reached the screen,
  and `SoftwareGraphics.DrawImage` carried a TODO admitting it. Alpha now
  means what it says: `FastColor.Blend` does the source-over composite,
  `SoftwareGraphics` applies it in the one place a colour reaches the
  framebuffer (a new `StorePixel`, which the public and private
  `DrawPixel` both go through), and `SDLGraphics` sets the renderer's
  draw blend mode to `SDL_BLENDMODE_BLEND` at creation - SDL's default is
  `NONE`, which ignores the alpha it is handed. Every existing draw is
  opaque, so nothing else changes; the opaque case skips the framebuffer
  read.
- The blend takes an opaque destination and returns an opaque result:
  every caller composites into a framebuffer, which is opaque by
  construction. SDL's depth layer needs no change - it is cleared
  transparent and composited with `BLEND`, so a translucent colour
  written straight into it lands with the alpha it should.
- **Elite's explosion cloud fades as it spreads** rather than staying
  solid white for its whole life, which is all the BBC could do. Gated on
  the same rendition test that gates shading: an indexed rendition can
  show no colour its palette does not name, so it keeps the flat white.
- **SCR's opponent shadow is translucent**, so the road's own markings
  show through it and the quad reads as a shadow rather than a hole. The
  Amiga had no transparency and filled it solid.
- Both are deliberate departures from the 1984/1989 originals, taken on
  the maintainer's call.

### Added (Bilinear filtering and mipmaps for textured triangles, 2026-08-22)

- **`SampleTexture` was nearest-neighbour**, so distant/foreshortened
  textured faces - SCR's road-line strips, seen nearly edge-on - aliased.
  It now samples bilinearly, and both textured-triangle rasterisers
  (`DrawTriangleTextured`, affine; `DrawTriangleTexturedDepth`,
  perspective-correct) draw from a box-filtered mip chain built once per
  source texture and cached in `SoftwareGraphics.Texturing.cs`. The affine
  path picks one mip level per triangle from its texel-to-screen area
  ratio; the perspective-correct path (used by SCR's road) picks one per
  scanline from the recovered UV span at each end, since a single
  receding quad's texel density varies too much for one triangle-wide
  level. Elite draws no textures, so it is unaffected.
- `TexturedFillTests.TextureMapsAcrossPolygon` narrowed its pure-colour
  assertions to the quarter-texel band nearest each edge, since bilinear
  filtering now blends across the texel boundary in the middle.

### Added (Outside/chase view on Backspace, 2026-08-20)

- **The player's car existed only as a cockpit.** Backspace now swaps the
  driver's seat for a chase camera behind and above the car, drawing the
  car itself - the remake's `bOutsideView`
  (`StuntCarRacer.cpp:1727-1729`). The viewpoint offset is the reference's
  (0xc0 up, 0x300 back) rotated by the car's own orientation, so the
  camera rolls and pitches with the car rather than hanging level behind
  it. Like the other race keys it works while paused.
- **`PlayerRenderer` orients the shared `CarMesh` on the player's own
  frame**, from four corners rotated out of the car's angles by the new
  `CarPhysics.RotateToWorld` (the original `WorldOffset`) - the reference
  builds the same thing as a world matrix in `SetCarWorldTransform`. The
  opponent keeps orienting on measured wheel positions, which it has and
  the player does not.
- The cockpit overlay is skipped in the outside view, as the reference
  skips `DrawCockpit`; the text overlays stay.
- **The car is drawn on the road, not through it.** Its centre is not its
  wheel line: whenever the suspension bottoms out the body drops below the
  road surface, and a mesh hung off the raw centre drew half-buried in the
  track (measured at up to 157 track units under, against a car 40 units
  from centre to wheel). The mesh now carries the remake's VCAR_HEIGHT/3
  ride height and is lifted clear of the road heights under its wheels -
  rigidly, so it keeps the roll and pitch the angles give it. That is the
  player's version of the max(road, actual) heights the opponent already
  draws itself on.

### Added (Mid-race 'M' returns to the track menu, 2026-08-20)

- **A race could only be left by quitting.** The port handled 'M' on the
  game-over and track-preview screens, but `RaceScreen` had no way back to
  the track menu short of Escape-quitting the app - the remake returns from
  any mode on 'M' (`StuntCarRacer.cpp:1731-1741`), which the preview
  screen's own on-screen controls list already promised. 'M' now leaves the
  race for the track menu, and works while paused as the reference does.
- **The rest of what the reference does on that key lives in
  `TrackMenuScreen.Reset`**: the engine sound stops and the opponent is
  cleared (`OpponentPhysics.Clear`, the port's `opponentsID =
  NO_OPPONENT`), so every route into the menu behaves the same rather than
  each caller repeating it. The drawbridge half was already covered - the
  next race resets it on entry.

### Added (One text rasteriser for both backends, and .fon/TrueType font kinds, 2026-08-20)

- **The two backends drew text by different means and so drew it
  differently.** `SoftwareGraphics` rasterised each rendition's own font
  sheets while `SDLGraphics` ignored them and rendered OpenSans through
  SDL_ttf, so the same game on the same rendition had different glyphs,
  metrics and layout depending on the `Backend` setting. Every kind now
  rasterises to a `FastBitmap` through one `IFontRasteriser`, and each
  backend only presents the result - software blits it, hardware uploads
  it into the `(font, text, colour)` texture cache it already kept.
  Matching output is structural rather than two paths kept in step.
- **Three kinds, chosen by `engine.graphics.fontKind`**: `Bitmap` (the
  default - the rendition's own sheets), `Fon` (a Windows `.fon`) and
  `TrueType`. Both games read it; the choice applies immediately, since
  every kind a rendition declares is loaded at startup and
  `IGraphics.FontKind` swaps between them and clears the stale text
  caches. A rendition that declares no font of the chosen kind draws with
  its own sheets rather than failing.
- **`FonFontReader` reads Windows `.fon` files** - the MZ/NE container,
  every `0x8008` FNT resource with the nearest strike to the height
  wanted, FNT 2.0 and 3.0, fixed and proportional pitch, and the
  column-major glyph packing. Every field is bounds-checked, so a
  truncated file fails naming itself.
- **The manifest groups fonts the way the folder does**: one `Fonts`
  section with a `Bitmap`, `Fon` and `TrueType` subsection, named as the
  `FontKind` setting names them, in place of three flat `FontsBitmap`,
  `FontsFON` and `FontsTrueType` sections. Manifests ship with the
  renditions, so the old shape is not read - a section the build does not
  recognise is refused when the manifest is read, rather than read as
  declaring nothing and failing later with an asset it cannot find.
- **Fonts belong to renditions, and all kinds share one `Fonts/`
  folder.** `FontsBitmap/`, `FontsFON/` and `FontsTrueType/` collapsed
  into `Fonts/`: what differs between a sheet, a `.fon` and a face is how
  the manifest declares it, not where the file sits. The 8-bit rendition
  declares all three, the 16-bit one its sheets and OpenSans, and the
  game's own `Assets/` keeps only audio.
- **Elite's Engine Settings screen carries a `Font:` row**, beside the
  other choices about how the world is drawn, offering Bitmap, FON and
  TrueType. It has no restart marker: the row writes the config and the
  running renderer together, the way the Music row does with the audio
  controller.
- **The 8-bit rendition's `.fon` and TrueType fonts come from VileR's
  Oldschool PC Font Resource** (https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/) -
  `Bm437_Master_512.FON` and `Mx437_Master_512.ttf`. They are the same
  character ROM as the rendition's own `bbc-micro.bmp` sheet, which is
  how the three kinds were checked against each other: all three draw the
  commander-status screen to identical pixels, from three independent
  code paths.

### Added ('R' turn-around key in Stunt Car Racer, 2026-08-19)

- **'R' points the car the opposite way during a race** - the remake adds
  half a turn to the player y angle and raises `INITIALISE_PLAYER` to push
  the new angle into the physics (`StuntCarRacer.cpp:1039-1045`). It is the
  way back for a car that ends up facing backwards.
- **The port needs only the angle flip.** The reference kept a copy of the
  player position and angles outside `CarBehaviour` and used
  `INITIALISE_PLAYER` to copy them in; `CarPhysics` holds the angle itself,
  so `CarPhysics.TurnAround` is the whole of the behaviour.
- **The key is race-only and works while paused**, as the reference has it:
  it sits ahead of the paused return in `RaceScreen`, so a turn taken while
  paused applies on the next physics frame.

### Added (Debug freezes and stats overlay in Stunt Car Racer, 2026-08-19)

- **F5 toggles a stats overlay, F6 freezes the player's car and F7 the
  opponent's** - the remake's dev aids (`bShowStats`, `bPlayerPaused`,
  `bOpponentPaused`, `StuntCarRacer.cpp:1706-1716`), split from the race
  pause item when that landed. Toggles rather than the pause's two-key
  pair, as the reference has them.
- **The freezes match where the reference applies them.** F6 skips the
  player's physics outright (`CarBehaviour`,
  `StuntCarRacer.cpp:1056-1063`), leaving the race clock, lap data and
  damage running; F7 freezes the opponent inside its own update, which
  still tracks the distance between the cars
  (`Opponent_Behaviour.cpp:376-383`) - `OpponentPhysics.Update(bool)`
  already carried that overload and is now wired to it. Both clear when a
  race starts (`StuntCarRacer.cpp:1254`, `:1312`).
- **The overlay shows what the other debug keys change**: the frame gap
  F9/F10 tune, with its resulting physics rate, and the state of the two
  freezes. The reference printed DXUT's frame and device stats, which
  have no meaning in this port.

### Added (Race pause in Stunt Car Racer, 2026-08-19)

- **The race pauses on 'P' and resumes on 'O',** as the remake does
  (`bPaused`, `StuntCarRacer.cpp:1743-1749`). No pause existed before.
  Two keys rather than one toggle, matching the reference, so a repeated
  press is harmless and no key-down latch is needed alongside
  `IsPressed`'s one-shot read.
- **Pausing silences the engine and freezes everything the race
  advances**: the physics step, the drawbridge, and `RaceTick` - which
  the lap and result timers count, so a pause cannot inflate a lap time.
  The reference drove its race timing from the wall clock and so kept
  counting while paused; this port replaced that with the tick, and
  freezing it is the behaviour the wall clock was standing in for.
- **The keys are race-only.** The reference's `bPaused` is global and
  also freezes the track menu's orbiting camera; that one line is
  deliberately not ported, since pause is a race concern and the
  reference already exempts GAME_OVER from it.
- **`RaceScreen` now takes `ISound`,** as `GameOverScreen` already did,
  to stop the engine loop. `StopLoop` is idempotent in both backends, so
  it is called every paused tick exactly as the reference calls
  `StopEngineSound`.

### Changed (HUD-helper survey closed as nothing to share, 2026-08-19)

- **The backlog's shared text/HUD-panel helper is closed without code.**
  The item asked for a survey of both games' HUDs first, and to lift only
  what both actually use. The survey found that set is empty, so the item
  moved to the roadmap's Won't section with its findings rather than
  producing an abstraction with one caller per shape.
- **Text layout is already shared.** `DrawTextLeft`, `DrawTextCentre` and
  `DrawTextRight` sit on `IGraphics`, and both games call them directly;
  the item was written before they got there.
- **Above that the two games have no common ground.** Elite's chrome is
  viewport-relative and per tier — `BaseView8Bit` places everything on an
  8x8 character grid, `BaseView16Bit` against a proportional font — and
  `IBaseView` already shares what the tiers have in common. SCR draws no
  border, no header rule and no panel rect at all, and its three text
  sites each measure from a different origin.

### Added (F9/F10 frame-gap tuning keys in Stunt Car Racer, 2026-08-19)

- **The physics frame gap can now be tuned while the game runs.** Both C++
  versions adjust it live, and `Race.FrameGap` has been settable for exactly
  this, but no key touched it. `StuntCarRacerMain.Update` now reads F9 and
  F10 alongside the other global keys: F9 steps the physics more often, F10
  less often.
- **F9 stops at a gap of one, F10 has no upper stop**, matching ptitSeb's
  `StuntCarRacer.cpp:1719-1723`. A gap of one is the physics running on
  every 50Hz tick; the default stays 4 (12.5Hz), as the remake's
  `DEFAULT_FRAME_GAP` does.
- **The keys are global, not race-only**, again as the reference is - the
  gap applies wherever the physics steps.

### Added (Level of detail on distant ships, 2026-08-15)

- **A ship too small on screen to show its hull detail no longer draws it.**
  `ShipBase.Draw`'s docstring has flagged "not showing detail at distance"
  as unimplemented since the port began. `DrawModelFaces` now skips a
  model's decal faces and its 2-point detail lines once the whole ship
  projects to less than 16 pixels of radius; the hull itself always draws.
- **The threshold is a screen size, not a range.** A decal spans roughly a
  fifth of the hull, so at 16 pixels of radius it covers about six pixels -
  the point where it stops reading as a shape and starts speckling the face
  it sits on. Because the test is on the projected size, a large ship keeps
  its detail further out than a small one, and a wider rendition keeps it as
  long as the commander can still see it.
- **Detail is what the model already says it is.** A decal is a face rooted
  to an earlier face's plane and a detail line is a face of fewer than three
  points - both facts `ModelGeometry` derives, so nothing new is stored and
  no model data changes. It also relieves the polygon-cap pressure noted in
  the issues backlog, since the faces dropped are the ones a crowded frame
  has most of.

### Added (Frustum culling for whole ships, 2026-08-15)

- **A ship the viewport cannot show is no longer transformed.** Every object
  in the universe list used to be transformed and walked face by face every
  frame whether or not any part of it could be on screen. `ShipBase.Draw`
  now rejects the whole ship first, as a bounding sphere against the view
  frustum, and returns before touching a single point.
- **`SharpKind.Graphics.ViewFrustum` is the six planes a
  `PerspectiveProjector` fills a viewport with.** The four side planes are
  the projection read backwards - inside the left edge is
  `Centre.X + (Focus * x / z) >= left`, and multiplying through by z turns
  that into a plane through the camera origin - plus the near and far
  depths. The sphere test is conservative, so a ship with any part on screen
  always draws.
- **The far plane exists as a stage.** Elite passes the range `Space`
  already removes a ship at (57344), so the frustum has its sixth plane
  without imposing a new rule about what the commander can see.
- **The bounding radius comes from the model, not from `Size`.** `Size` is
  the collision radius squared and need not agree with the geometry, and a
  cull that rejects a ship the model would have drawn is a hole in the hull.
  It is found once per instance alongside the face roots, and rotating a
  model about its origin cannot move it outside that sphere, so one test
  covers every orientation.

### Added (Credits screen, a way out of the options, and Window Scale, 2026-08-10)

- **The credits are a screen of their own.** The version and the three
  credit lines used to sit as a footer under the options rows, competing
  with the menu for the screen; a Credits row now opens them on their own
  page, with a Back row that returns to the options. Both tiers draw it -
  8-bit word-wraps the names to its 40-column row, 16-bit gives each one a
  line - and `CreditsModel` joins the screens a rendition has to supply.
- **The options menu has a Back row.** It is the last row, under Quit,
  where the settings screens put theirs, and it returns to the screen the
  commander opened the options from rather than to a fixed one:
  `GameState.EnterOptions` records that at the F11 press, so a settings
  screen returning to the options with a plain `SetView` leaves it alone
  and Back still leads all the way out. Before this, opening the options
  from the title or ship-parade screens left no way back to them.
- **The key that opens the options closes them.** F11 pressed on the options
  does what Back does; pressed on a screen the options themselves led to, it
  returns to the options without moving where Back leads. Both used to leave
  Back returning into the menu it was trying to leave.
- **The menu cursors wrap.** Up from the first row of the options menu or
  either settings screen lands on Back, which is the last row on all three,
  and down from Back returns to the first. The cursors used to stop at the
  ends.
- **Window Scale is a setting rather than a hand-edit.** It joins the
  engine settings screen beside Backend and Rendition, marked `*` because
  the window is made before the screen exists. The scales offered are the
  rendition's - `IRendition.WindowScales` and `DefaultWindowScale`, with
  8-bit offering 1x, 2x and 4x (4x by default) and 16-bit 1x and 2x (2x) -
  since a canvas that is already 640 wide has less room to grow than one
  that is 320.
- **A hand-edited scale is pegged rather than discarded.** The config file
  cannot judge one on its own: which scales exist is the chosen rendition's
  answer, and the rendition is not loaded until after the file is read. So
  `EngineConfigSettings.WindowScale` became nullable - null meaning the
  commander has never chosen, which 1 cannot stand in for - and
  `WindowScales.Resolve` settles it once the rendition is known, taking the
  rendition's default when unchosen and the nearest offered scale (ties to
  the larger) when not. A file asking for 3 on the 8-bit tier now opens at
  4x instead of falling back to 1.

### Added (Gouraud shading, 2026-08-10)

- **`SharpKind.Graphics.Rendering.VertexNormals`** derives the per-vertex
  normals the `.obj` assets never carried, by averaging the faces meeting at
  each corner. Per face *and* corner rather than per vertex, because the
  vertex on a cube's corner has three right answers - one per face.
- **A 45-degree crease keeps the models faceted where they mean to be.**
  Averaging every adjacent face would round off edges the artist drew, and
  both games' ships are faceted by design; faces only smooth together when
  they turn through less than 45 degrees, so a curve drawn as facets shades
  as a curve while a hull's real edges stay hard. Elite's missile still
  renders as sharply as it did flat, which is the threshold working.
- **Decals and detail lines are excluded from the averaging.** A cockpit
  window lies in the plane of the hull face beneath it, so its normal is that
  plane's; counting it would weight the plane twice at every corner it
  touches and pull the corner back towards flat. They keep the flat fill and
  the depth bias that settles them against the face they sit on.
- **The near-plane clipper carries the colour.** `NearPlaneClip` gained a
  colour-interpolating overload beside its texture-coordinate one, so a
  corner the clipper invents gets the colour the face had where the plane cut
  it - a face straddling the camera plane blends correctly rather than
  jumping to a neighbour's shade.
- **The fill blends and quantises per pixel.** `DrawPolygonFilledDepth` gained
  a per-corner-colour overload in both backends - `SoftwareGraphics.Gouraud`
  and the CPU depth layer in `SDLGraphics.Gouraud`, which mirrors it as the
  rest of that layer mirrors the software one. Unlike the flat fill, the
  quantiser is asked at every pixel whether it dithers or not: a blended
  colour is a different colour at each pixel, so there is nothing the caller
  could have resolved once for the whole face. The blend is affine rather
  than divided by depth - a shade has no perspective to be correct about the
  way a texture coordinate does.
- **A strategy that cannot blend stands the face down to one colour.** The
  painter's chain and the wireframe outline take `VertexColours.Flatten`, the
  mean of the corners, so a caller submits per-vertex colours without first
  asking which strategy is in force.
- **Gouraud is offered only where it would show.** An indexed rendition can
  display no colour its palette does not name, so a gradient quantises
  straight back to the handful of steps a flat fill already gives; the 8-bit
  tier keeps flat Lambert whatever the commander selects, the same way a
  rendition with no colours to spare for shading stays Unlit.

### Added (flat per-face lighting on the 16-bit tier, 2026-08-09)

- **`SharpKind.Graphics.Rendering.LambertShading`** is the first lighting of
  any kind in either game: one directional light dotted against a face's own
  normal, modulating the face's colour. The light is fixed in camera space,
  and the Lambert term is lifted onto an ambient floor so a face turned away
  goes dim rather than to a black silhouette.
- **Elite's ships light for free.** `ShipBase` already rotated each face's
  normal into camera space for the backface cull; `IsFacingCamera` now hands
  that vector back instead of discarding it, so shading costs a dot product
  and no extra transform. A detail line, which has no normal of its own, has
  no direction to light and keeps its flat colour.
- **The models' hand-painted shading is taken back out first.** They pre-date
  lighting and fake it by giving a face a darker shade of its material - the
  Coriolis station is eight faces of one grey, four of a lighter one, two
  lighter again. Lighting those directly lit an already-lit model twice, and
  the hand-picked shades read as flicker rather than form. `UnlitBase` scales
  a face back to full brightness first, so a model's whole grey family becomes
  one grey and comes apart again by facing. No model asset changed: face
  colours resolve from material names through the rendition's palette, so this
  is derived at draw time and works for any rendition.
- **A lit model stays near the brightness its artist painted it.** The rescale
  goes to the brightest channel the model uses anywhere plus a quarter of
  headroom - `0xAA` for the 16-bit station, painted in greys no lighter than
  `0x88` - rather than to a flat 255, which turned the station white. The
  headroom buys shades where a tier quantises: stopping dead at `0x88` leaves
  only six of the 16-bit tier's sixteen greys, and adjacent faces then round
  to the same one about one time in six; `0xAA` gives eight and measurably
  fewer. The peak is found once per model, beside the face roots.
- **The pipeline's three stages are three independent choices**, as they are
  in any rasteriser: how a primitive is filled (`FillMode`), what colour a
  face gets (`IShadingModel` - `LambertShading` or `UnlitShading`), and how
  that colour is reduced to what the display can show (`IColourQuantiser` -
  `ChannelGridQuantiser` or `PaletteQuantiser`, either wrapped in
  `OrderedDitherQuantiser`). Shading and quantisation were branches inside
  `EliteDraw` and are now the two interfaces, so Gouraud is a second shading
  model rather than a new flag. Only `Solid` gates the other two, the way
  lighting is meaningless when drawing outlines; dithering and shading are
  otherwise free of each other.
- **A rendition decides whether it shades at all**, via `IRendition.ShadesShips`
  - a fact about the machine being stood in for, not a setting. Both tiers
  shade, and each quantises the result the way its hardware would: the 16-bit
  tier to the nearest level its DAC drives, the 8-bit tier to the nearest
  colour its palette names, because an indexed machine could show nothing
  else. Lighting therefore cannot invent a colour the asset validator would
  have rejected in a bitmap.
- **The 8-bit greys are evenly spaced**, `000000` through `FFFFFF` in six
  steps. They were `.NET` colour names whose values bunched (`DimGray` 105 and
  `Gray` 128 nearly together, then a gap to 169), which left two of the six
  entries unreachable when a lit face picked the nearest - the station came
  out in three tones where the 16-bit tier had nine. `scanner.bmp` carries two
  of those greys in its own indexed palette and was remapped to match, since
  the tier's palette is its whole colour set.
- **The three stages are three settings**, named for what they are:
  `engine.graphics.fillMode` (was `graphicStyle`), `shading` (`Unlit` or
  `Lambert`, replacing the `lighting` bool) and `quantisation` (`Nearest` or
  `Ordered`). All three have a row on the Engine Settings screen - **Fill
  Mode**, **Shading**, **Quantisation** - saved the moment they change, read
  per frame so they take effect on the next one, and shown whether or not the
  rendition in use shades, the same way Depth Sort is shown in a wireframe
  world. `GraphicStyle` the type is now `FillMode`.
- **Ordered (Bayer) dithering**, `OrderedDitherQuantiser`: nudge the wanted
  colour by where the pixel falls in a 4x4 threshold matrix, then take the
  nearest displayable colour as usual, so a colour between two of them
  resolves to a mix of both. It decorates whichever quantiser the rendition
  already uses rather than replacing it, since what a display can show is not
  the commander's choice. Each quantiser reports its own `LevelGap` - exact
  for an evenly spaced DAC, measured from the entries for a hand-picked
  palette - and the nudge spans one gap, so a dither reaches the colour either
  side and no further. On the 16-bit station it turns five greys into eight,
  mixed within each face.
- **The fill asks a dither per pixel.** `IPolygonRenderer.Submit` and the two
  `IGraphics` polygon fills gained an overload carrying the quantiser down to
  `DrawSpanFilledDepth`, where it is applied per pixel; a quantiser that is
  not position-dependent still resolves once per face and nothing travels.
  The SDL backend ignores it - it fills on the GPU and has no per-pixel hook,
  so dithering is a Software-backend feature.
- Verified live against the Coriolis station, the model whose hand-painted
  greys showed the problem: it reads as one lit solid on both tiers and keeps
  its grey cast, spanning 0x33-0x88 at 16-bit and 0x66-0xCC at 8-bit - each
  tier topping out at its own model's lightest painted grey, which is why the
  two differ. With the setting off the flat fill returns exactly.
- Follow-on left open in the [backlog](docs/backlog-roadmap.md): Gouraud
  shading.

### Changed (one shared perspective projection, 2026-08-09)

- **`SharpKind.Graphics.PerspectiveProjector`** is the projection both games
  were writing out by hand: a focal length and a viewport centre, and
  `Project` putting a camera-space point on screen as
  `centre + focus * x / z` with y inverted. It sits beside `NearPlaneClip`,
  which is the stage that has to run before it.
- **Elite's five inlined copies are down to one.** `IEliteDraw.Projector`
  builds it from the `Focus` and viewport it already exposed, and
  `ShipBase.ProjectPoint`, `ShipBase.ProjectCameraPoint`,
  `EliteDraw.ProjectExplosionPoints` and `WorldProjection.TryProject` all go
  through it. The near-plane depth clamp stays in `ShipBase` and the
  `Focus / 256` world-radius scale stays in `WorldProjection`: neither is
  part of projecting a point, and both are Elite's alone.
- **SCR's `Scene3D` holds one** instead of a `_focus`/`_halfWidth`/
  `_halfHeight` triple, set in `SetView`. Its fixed-point view transform is
  untouched - only the projection at the end of it was ever shared.
- This is the first slice of the clip-space pipeline item still open in the
  [backlog](docs/backlog-roadmap.md).

### Changed (`IGraphics` no longer reports the screen size, 2026-08-09)

- **`IGraphics.ScreenWidth` and `IGraphics.ScreenHeight` are gone.** The
  interface is a set of drawing operations; where a thing goes is the caller's
  decision, and a caller needing the screen's extent to make it now says so.
  The two implementations keep the size for their own clipping, buffers and
  the `Centre` overloads, which is where it was always actually used.
- **`SharpKind.Graphics.ScreenLayout`**, a record of the render target's size,
  is what those callers ask for instead. `IAbstraction` exposes one - it is
  constructed with the size already - and `AddGameEngine` registers it, so
  nothing has to be told the size twice.
- **Elite's `ViewLayout` derives from it** rather than repeating the two
  fields, keeping its scanner-derived viewport on top of the shared metrics.
  SCR's renderers and screens, and the UI gallery, take a `ScreenLayout`
  alongside the `IGraphics` they draw with.
- **`EliteRenderingServiceCollectionExtensions`** holds the rendering
  registrations, split out of `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions` because the
  extra type pushed that class over CA1506's coupling limit.

### Changed (the control library, its namespaces and its bindings, 2026-08-06)

- **`SharpKind.Widgets` is now `SharpKind.UI`, and `SharpKind.Controls` is now
  `SharpKind.Input`.** The two were a namespace apart and a word from meaning the
  same thing, while being opposite halves of the problem: one draws, the other
  reads the keyboard. `WidgetStyle`, `WidgetState` and `WidgetColors` follow
  the library into `ControlStyle`, `ControlState` and `ControlColors`.
- **`UIControl`**, an abstract base, replaces the `IWidget` interface. Every
  control is built the same way - `(IGraphics, ControlStyle, ISetting)` - and
  a control that cannot be constructed without a binding cannot hold its own
  copy of what it shows.
- **`Label` is bound rather than told.** `Label.Text` was settable and is now
  read from the binding at each draw, so a label whose content changes needs
  nothing done to it. The gallery's clock is the demonstration: a setting that
  answers with the time, and a label nobody touches after it is built.
- **`ComboBox` takes one style, not two.** It strips the backgrounds itself
  through `ControlStyle.WithoutBackground()`: that the value and arrows draw
  over the row's own block is the row's rule about the order it draws in, not
  something for a caller to know and supply a second style for.
- **`ISetting.Value`**, a default-implemented current value in text, derived
  from `Values`/`SelectedIndex` so no existing setting changes. It is what a
  control showing or editing one value works in, where `SelectedIndex` is what
  a control choosing between several works in.

### Added (a button and a text box, 2026-08-06)

- **`Button`**: a caption bound to a setting with one value; pressing it
  applies that choice, and the setting's setter is where the consequence
  lives. **`TextBox`**: a line of typed text written straight through to
  `ISetting.Value`, with `TextSetting` as the free-text binding both it and a
  fixed caption use.
- The gallery grew a section for each, and the clock label; its cursor now
  moves across every row that takes input, with Tab to leave the text box
  (where S and X are typed rather than navigated with).

### Added (a widget library, and the settings screens built on it, 2026-08-05)

- **`SharpKind.UI`**: `Label`, `Container<TControl>` and `ComboBox`, each
  owning its own bounds and drawing everything relative to them. A widget
  holds how it draws and never what is true — a `ComboBox` reads and writes
  its value through an injected `ISetting` and keeps no copy — which is what
  lets the same widget serve two renditions without either one becoming the
  authority on a setting. See [decisions.md](docs/decisions.md).
- **`IGraphics.MeasureText`**: the size a string would occupy in a given font.
  Text can now be aligned inside a widget's own bounds rather than against the
  screen, which is what `DrawTextCentre` measures against.
- **`SharpKind.UI.Gallery`**: a window showing every widget in every state,
  with each one's bounds outlined, and the combo boxes live. Runs on either
  backend — the software one draws from an 8x8 bitmap sheet and the hardware
  one from a 12pt true-type face, and the gallery measures its row pitch so
  the same layout fits both.

  ```
  dotnet run --project src/useful/apps/SharpKind.UI.Gallery
  ```

### Changed (settings screens, 2026-08-05)

- **Left and Right now cycle a setting in opposite directions.** Both used to
  advance, because the enums behind the settings only offered a "next"; a
  setting bound to an index can go either way.
- **A selected setting shows its value bracketed** — `< Wireframe >` — where
  there is more than one value to cycle to.
- The settings screens no longer have a view per rendition. A rendition
  supplies a `SettingsListStyle` (colours and positions) and the game owns the
  widgets, so `SettingsListModel`, `SettingsRow` and the two `SettingsListView*`
  classes are gone, along with both screens' `SettingValue`/`ToggleSetting`
  switch statements.

### Fixed (the benchmark suites actually run again, 2026-08-05)

- **Every benchmark project was broken in a different way**, all of them
  invisibly, because the benchmark-history workflow is manually triggered
  and the failures are not build failures. Found while fixing the artifacts
  path below, and fixed together since none of them is worth much alone:
  - `SharpKind.Graphics.Benchmarks`: `SoftwareGraphicsBenchmarks.Create` threw
    "The 16-bit asset set is missing its palette" - `FakeAssetLocator`
    points `PalettePath` at the consuming project's own output and this
    project had no palette there. One throwing benchmark suppresses the
    whole class's summary export, so the class produced no results at all.
    It now carries an `Assets/Palette/palette.json` fixture of its own,
    copied to output. Not a project reference to a rendition, which is how
    the Elite benchmarks get theirs: SharpKind does not depend on either game.
  - `EliteSharpLib.Benchmarks`: every benchmark threw in its constructor
    with `KeyNotFoundException: 'Scanner'`. `EliteDraw` needs the
    rendition's artwork and a bare `FakeAssetLocator` has none. The project
    now copies the 16-bit rendition under `Renditions/` the way the app and
    the test project do, and a new `BenchmarkAssets.Locator()` composes it
    with the game's assets through `RenditionAssets` - the same composition
    `EliteSharpLib.Tests` builds, and the one the benchmarks are supposed to
    be measuring. All six benchmarks now report real numbers.
  - `EliteSharpLib.Benchmarks` and `SharpKind.Input.Benchmarks` also both
    refused to run at all whenever a git worktree checkout sits nested under
    the repo: BenchmarkDotNet's per-run project generation looks the project
    up by name across the whole tree and throws on more than one match.
    Both now use `InProcessNoEmitToolchain`, as `SharpKind.Graphics.Benchmarks`
    already did.

### Fixed (benchmark artifacts path, 2026-08-05)

- **All three benchmark projects wrote their reports where nothing looked
  for them.** `EliteSharpLib.Benchmarks`, `SharpKind.Input.Benchmarks` and
  `SharpKind.Graphics.Benchmarks` each passed
  `WithArtifactsPath("../../../reports")`, which from the project directory
  resolves to `src/reports/`. Two things expected `<project>/reports/`
  instead: `.gitignore`'s `src/*/perf/*/reports/` rule, so every local run
  left untracked files behind; and, more seriously, every
  `output-file-path` in `.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml`, so the
  benchmark-history workflow has been reading files that were never
  written since the reports directories were first ignored (d9ea0dbb).
  The path is now `"reports"` in all three, matching both. Verified by
  running each suite and confirming the exact JSON path the workflow names
  now exists and is git-ignored.

### Changed (off-screen face cost profiled, 2026-08-05)

- **Frustum side-plane clipping measured and declined.** The backlog carried
  an item saying left/right/top/bottom clipping happens after projection, in
  the per-scanline span clamps of `DrawTriangleFilled`, and asked for a
  profile before anything was changed. New `OffScreenTriangleBenchmarks`
  (`src/useful/perf/SharpKind.Graphics.Benchmarks`) measures a face wholly off
  to the side (1.79 us), one straddling an edge (1.78 us) and one off the
  top (8 ns - already rejected by the Y clamp), against a full-screen fill
  (93.7 us) and a small on-screen face (536 ns) at 512x512. The wasted work
  is 2% of one legitimate full-screen face, so the item moved to Won't in
  [backlog-issues.md](docs/backlog-issues.md) with the numbers attached.
- **Fixed a Release-build break** in `EliteSharpLib.Tests/TestAssets.cs`:
  the rendition-folder field introduced by the previous commit was a
  `static readonly` without the `s_` prefix the analyzers require (IDE1006),
  which failed the build before any test could run.

### Changed (star count now per-tier, 16-bit starfield softened, 2026-08-05)

- **Star count was fixed regardless of screen area** (issue #4): the
  original's NOSTM values (18 normal-space stars, 3 in witchspace) were
  used unscaled at every tier, so the 8-bit tier's 320x256 canvas rendered
  a starfield four times as dense as 512x512, and the 16-bit tier's
  640x512 changed the ratio again. Rather than deriving each tier's count
  from a formula, `IStarfieldRenderer` now exposes `NormalSpaceStarCount`
  and `WitchspaceStarCount` so each rendition tunes its own by eye - the
  8-bit tier keeps the original 18/3, the 16-bit tier uses 55/9.
  `Stars.CreateNewStars`/`CreateNewWitchspaceStars` (`EliteSharpLib/Stars.cs`)
  read these instead of a hardcoded default, and the star buffer is sized
  to match instead of a fixed 20-slot array.
- **16-bit starfield polish:** at 640x512 a near star's growing pixels
  (`StarfieldRendererBase.Draw`, drawn once a star passes `WideDistance`/
  `BlockDistance`) read as a flat white square rather than a bright point.
  `StarfieldRenderer16Bit` now draws those extra pixels in a dimmer
  `LighterGrey` halo instead of solid white - a lightweight stand-in for
  anti-aliasing that needed no change to the shared `IGraphics` pixel API,
  which has no alpha-blended draw path. The 8-bit tier is unaffected
  (`HaloColour` defaults to the star's own colour).

### Fixed (16-bit screens re-laid-out for 640 width, 2026-08-04)

- **Eight 16-bit screens were still laid out for 512 on the now-640-wide
  tier.** Their absolute coordinates were authored against 512x512 and
  never revisited when the tier widened on 2026-07-30, so centred and
  right-anchored content sat up to 128px short of where it belonged. Fixed
  by re-authoring each screen against 640, following `ScannerView16Bit`'s
  existing precedent (left-anchored content unchanged, right-anchored
  content shifted the full 128, centred content shifted half, 64):
  - `MarketView16Bit` and `EquipmentView16Bit`: table columns spread wider,
    highlight-row width now derived from `Layout.ViewportWidth`.
  - `CommanderStatusView16Bit`: the equipment list's second column moved
    further right.
  - `PlanetDataView16Bit`: the description block widened to use the extra
    width.
  - `GalacticChartView16Bit`: the star field (still 512-wide in galaxy
    space) is now centred in the 640-wide viewport with a fixed offset,
    rather than stretched.
  - `MissionBriefingView16Bit`: the single-paragraph block re-centred, the
    two-paragraph lower block widened, and the portrait moved toward the
    new right edge.
  - `SaveCommanderView16Bit`: the name-entry box re-centred under its
    already-correct, already-centred text.
  - `InventoryView16Bit` was checked and needs no change - its columns are
    left-anchored well within both old and new widths.
  This was `docs/backlog-issues.md`'s only remaining Must; the file is now
  empty of Musts.

### Investigated (Docking-bay roll-alignment threshold, 2026-08-04)

- **Confirmed not a bug.** The backlog suspected `FlyToDockingBay`'s
  `0.9166f` roll-alignment threshold was ~2.7x too strict against the
  original's `|A| >= 33` check. That suspicion divided by the wrong
  denominator (96, the unit vector's own magnitude) instead of 36 (the
  dot product's own max magnitude after its implicit `>>8` scaling - the
  same shape of error as the equipment tech-level item below). The
  correct normalization is `33/36 ≈ 0.9167`, which is exactly the
  `0.9166f` already in the port. No code change.

### Fixed (Sun orientation, 2026-08-04)

- **The sun no longer rotates with the player's roll and pitch.** Traced
  `MV40`/`MV45` in the original: both planets and suns share the same
  position-space rotation (orbital motion around the player), but the sun
  specifically returns before the next step, which rotates an object's own
  orientation vectors and applies its spin - "we don't need to rotate the
  sun around its origin." `MoveUniverseObject` had no such early-out, so
  the sun's own facing rotated and span like any other object.

### Fixed (Firing-cone thresholds, 2026-08-04) [best-effort, see note]

- **Firing-cone thresholds now use a single re-derived gate.** The
  original's `CPX #160` (X <= -32 of a max magnitude 36, ≈ -0.889
  normalized) decides both whether a ship may fire and whether it sets
  its `Firing` flag - the same check, used twice. The port gated firing
  consideration at a looser `-0.833` and then re-checked a third,
  un-original `-0.917` threshold before setting the flag. Both are now
  `-0.889`, and `FiringTactics` sets the flag unconditionally once
  entered, matching "same gate for both." The final hit threshold
  (`-0.972`) was already confirmed faithful and is unchanged.
  **Caveat:** the disassembly's own prose translation of `CPX #160` into
  decimal ranges doesn't fully reconcile with standard two's-complement
  arithmetic on a full re-derivation; this fix trusts the stated intent
  (three graduated bands, matching the already-verified `-0.972` sibling
  value) over that literal byte-level puzzle. A companion investigation
  into 80-point missile splash damage was attempted but left unfixed -
  see [backlog-issues.md](docs/backlog-issues.md) - after the same kind
  of byte-layout reading produced a result too narrow to trust.

### Fixed (Stardust count, 2026-08-04)

- **Stardust count now varies by location, matching the original's two
  values.** The original shows 18 particles (`NOST`) in normal space,
  dropped to 3 in witchspace for a visibly emptier void. `Stars` always
  simulated and drew all 20 of its allocated slots regardless of
  location; it now tracks how many of those slots are active (`NOSTM`)
  and only simulates/draws that many.

### Fixed (Energy bomb vs Constrictor, 2026-08-04)

- **The energy bomb no longer spares the Constrictor (or the homebrew
  Cougar).** The original's bomb-kill sweep excludes only the space
  station and already-exploding ships - no ship-type check at all, so a
  detonated bomb kills a nearby Constrictor outright, bypassing its "only
  military lasers penetrate" shield gimmick. `IsDestroyedByBomb` had an
  explicit Constrictor (and Cougar) exclusion with no original
  counterpart.

### Fixed (Bounty hunters turning hostile, 2026-08-04)

- **Bounty hunters turning hostile at legal status 40 were entirely
  missing.** The original's `E%` blueprint table flags the Viper and
  Fer-de-lance as bounty hunters (`NEWB` bit 1); once the player's legal
  status reaches 40 (an "Offender," not yet the 50-threshold "Fugitive"),
  a bounty hunter turns hostile. The port had no such mechanic - worse,
  `CreateLoneWolf` overwrote a spawned ship's flags outright, discarding
  the `Police`/`Cloaked` flags its own prototype had already set (e.g.
  Fer-de-lance, Cougar), which also silently broke their existing
  `LegalStatus >= 64` police-hostility check. Added a `BountyHunter` flag
  (set on Fer-de-lance, matching the original), had `CreateLoneWolf` OR
  flags in instead of replacing them, and gated a bounty hunter's initial
  and ongoing hostility on `LegalStatus >= 40` in `ShipTactics`.

### Fixed (Mining/Military Laser tech-level gating, 2026-08-04)

- **Mining Laser and Military Laser were available a tech level too
  early.** Re-deriving the original's positional tech-gating formula (item
  at `PRXS` position *N* shows once `planet_tech >= N - 2`) shows Mining
  Laser needs tech 11 and Military Laser needs tech 10; the port had both
  at tech 9. Every other gated item (E.C.M., Fuel Scoops, Escape Pod,
  Energy Bomb, Energy Unit, Docking Computer, Galactic Hyperdrive) was
  re-checked against the same formula and already matched exactly - a
  prior backlog note suspecting E.C.M. was based on a mis-derivation.

### Fixed (Police-spawn legal status, 2026-08-04)

- **Police-spawn chance factored in legal status under an inverted
  condition.** The original ORs the player's legal status into the
  spawn-chance roll only when police are already present in the local
  bubble - modelling "they've already scanned you." `CheckForPolice` had
  the exact opposite condition, applying legal status only when *no*
  police were nearby.

### Fixed (Asteroid loot drops, 2026-08-04)

- **Asteroid loot drops were wrong on two counts.** Splinters should only
  drop from a mining-laser kill, not a Pulse-laser kill; and every kill,
  asteroids included, should still yield alloy plates and cargo canisters
  on top of any splinters. `DestroyTarget` instead made splinters and
  alloy/cargo mutually exclusive by ship type, and let Pulse-laser kills
  yield splinters too.

### Fixed (Witchspace Thargoid ambush, 2026-08-04)

- **Witchspace now always spawns exactly 4 Thargoids.** The original loops
  spawning Thargoids until the count exceeds 3, always ending with exactly
  4 - deterministic, not random. `EnterWitchspace` was spawning a random
  1-4 instead, so a misjump ambush sometimes gave only one Thargoid.

### Fixed (Fuel scooping rate, 2026-08-04)

- **Fuel scooping gained roughly 40x too much fuel per tick.** The original
  scoops `speed/80` light years per tick (0.1-0.5 LY across the speed
  range); `UpdateCabinTemp` was adding `speed/2` directly, 40x the intended
  rate against a 7 LY tank.

### Fixed (Scooping with a full hold, 2026-08-04)

- **A full cargo hold no longer damages the ship when scooping.** The
  original has two distinct outcomes: can't scoop at all (no fuel scoop, or
  the canister is above the ship) takes full collision damage; a scoop
  attempt that fails only because the hold is full just destroys the
  canister with a sound, no damage. `ScoopItem` collapsed both cases into
  one branch that always applied collision damage.

### Fixed (Legal status band, 2026-08-04)

- **A legal status of exactly 50 showed "Offender" instead of "Fugitive".**
  The original's `CPY #50` branches on carry, so 50 and above is Fugitive;
  `LegalStatusBand.For` used `bounty > 50`, misclassifying exactly 50.

### Fixed (Pack-hunter spawns, 2026-08-04)

- **Pack-hunter spawns were missing Cobra Mk III and used the wrong
  probability shape.** The original picks from 8 ship types via the AND of
  two random bytes reduced to 0-7, deliberately biased toward smaller
  indices (Sidewinder common, Cobra Mk III rare). `CreatePackHunter` had
  only 7 options, chosen with a flat `Random(7)`, and Cobra Mk III wasn't
  reachable at all.

### Fixed (Hyperspace misjump chance, 2026-08-04)

- **Hyperspace misjump chance was roughly a third too low.** The original
  triggers a misjump into witchspace when the random byte is `>= 253`
  (253, 254 or 255); `CompleteHyperspace` used `> 253`, matching only 254
  or 255 - a `>=` had become a `>`.

### Fixed (Docking Computer price, 2026-08-04)

- **Docking Computer cost 1500 Cr, should be 1000 Cr.** The original `PRXS`
  price table has it at 1000 Cr; the port's equipment stock had it at 1500,
  the same value as the Extra Energy Unit one row above - a copy/paste slip.

### Fixed (Missiles arrive, 2026-08-03)

- **A missile detonates when it gets there.** It was asking whether the
  distance to its target was under 256 where both the BBC 6502 and The New
  Kind ask whether each axis is - a sphere inscribed in the original's box,
  throwing away the corners and up to 443 units of reach. A missile that had
  arrived flew straight through, turned round and came back, which is why they
  seemed to take several passes to kill anything.
- Both games' reference sources are now written down in
  [reference-sources.md](docs/reference-sources.md) - which checkout to read
  and which one wins when they disagree (the BBC assembly for Elite,
  ptitSeb's fork for Stunt Car Racer). The two readmes link to it rather than
  carrying the detail, being for people who want to play the games.

### Fixed (The M key fires a missile again, 2026-08-03)

- **A bare `M` fires a missile again.** With `ELITE_DEBUG_MISSIONS` set, the
  Ctrl-M mission jump was reading the `M` key before checking Ctrl. A key
  press is read once and consumed, so the jump ate every bare `M` and then
  declined to run, leaving nothing for the missile. It tests Ctrl first now,
  and without consuming it - `Ctrl-H`'s galactic hyperspace was taking Ctrl
  away the same way and no longer does.
- `IKeyboard` gained **`IsHeld(ConsoleModifiers)`** for guards of the form
  "Ctrl decides what this key does", and its documentation now says which of
  the two to reach for.
- **The test keyboard models the one-shot contract.** `FakeKeyboard.IsPressed`
  answered every call, so no test could see two handlers act on one press.
  It consumes now, like the real keyboard.

### Changed (Renditions, 2026-08-03)

- Everything the game draws is now a **rendition**: a plugin holding the
  screens, the HUD, the way planets, suns, stars and ships are drawn, and the
  artwork, palette, fonts and models they are drawn with. The two that ship
  live in a **`Renditions` folder beside the executable** and are found at
  startup, the same way missions are. Nothing in the game knows which
  renditions exist, so adding one is a folder.
- **They need not be machines.** A rendition names itself and declares its own
  resolution and colour limits, so the next one can be futuristic, underwater
  or psychedelic at whatever size it likes - it is not limited to standing in
  for 8-bit or 16-bit hardware.
- **`engine.tier` is now `engine.rendition`**, and takes a name rather than
  `8Bit`/`16Bit`. Existing config files are read and upgraded the first time
  they are saved, so a commander keeps the look they had.
- The Engine Settings screen offers the renditions actually installed, so it
  is no longer possible to select one that is not there.
- **Fixed:** a police Viper showed purple on the 16-bit scanner and fired a
  cyan beam. A ship is one colour everywhere now, so the 16-bit beam is
  purple to match. 8-bit police stay cyan, where that palette's only purple
  is already the missile.
- No other visible change: both renditions draw exactly what they drew before.

### Changed (Screens become plugins, 2026-08-03)

- The 8-bit and 16-bit screens are no longer written into the game. Each tier
  is an assembly of its own — **`EliteSharp.Views.EightBit`** and
  **`EliteSharp.Views.SixteenBit`** — referencing the contracts and nothing
  else, and the game finds them at startup in a **`Views` folder beside the
  executable**, the same way it finds a mission. Adding a tier is now an
  assembly rather than a second branch in every screen registration.
- **The `Views` folder is required.** Delete it, or the pack for the tier
  configured in `engine.tier`, and the game refuses to start and says which
  tier it could not find — there is nothing to draw with. A pack missing a
  screen is refused the same way before the first frame, naming every screen it
  does not draw.
- The mission contracts assembly is now **`EliteSharp.Abstractions`**, one
  plugin-facing assembly subdivided by namespace, so a plugin of any kind
  references one thing. A mission plugin built against the old
  `EliteSharp.Missions.Abstractions` needs recompiling; nothing about what a
  mission *does* changed.
- No visible change to either tier: both draw exactly what they drew before.

### Changed (Missions become plugins, 2026-08-02)

- The two missions are no longer written into the game. They live in
  **`EliteSharp.Missions.Classic`**, an assembly that references the mission
  contracts and nothing else, and the game finds them at startup in a
  **`Missions` folder beside the executable** — the same way it would find
  anyone else's. Adding a mission is now a new assembly rather than edits to
  two enums, two controllers, two `Screen` values and four views.
- **Fixed:** the rumours about the stolen Constrictor were printed for whatever
  system was selected on the chart, so Reesdice was named from anywhere in the
  first galaxy. A rumour is somebody in the station talking, and is now only
  said about the system the commander is standing on.
- The two mission briefing screens are one screen, which lays itself out from
  what a briefing contains — a headline, how many paragraphs, whether somebody
  is pictured — rather than from which mission sent it. On the **8-bit tier the
  Constrictor debrief moves down the screen**, matching the Thargoid debrief;
  one rule cannot draw the two layouts they had drifted into. 16-bit is
  unchanged.
- Commander files hold only the mission stages actually reached, so a fresh
  commander writes none. A file naming a mission that nothing provides is
  refused and says which name it could not place — including when a mission's
  plugin has been removed.
- `ELITE_DEBUG_MISSIONS`' Ctrl-M jump now moves the commander to a real system
  rather than overwriting two of the docked planet's six seed bytes, so the
  chart, the planet name and the data screen agree afterwards.

### Changed (The 16-bit tier becomes a real 12-bit machine, 2026-08-01)

- The 2026-07-30 rename of the 16-bit palette to web colour names is backed
  out: the 29 ramp names (`LighterGrey`, `Gold`, `Lilac`, `RedOrange`…)
  return across `palette.json`, `palette.mtl`, the ~380 `usemtl` lines in
  the 31 `SixteenBit/*.obj` models and every `Palette["..."]` lookup on the
  16-bit path. `FractalPlanet` goes back to the plain shared lookup, since
  the names it wanted exist in both palettes again.
- In its place the tier gets the constraint that actually describes the
  hardware: a **12-bit DAC, 4096 colours**, four bits per channel. Every
  palette entry is now a value that hardware could produce — channels
  widened by replication (`0xE` → `0xEE`), never by a left shift (`0xE0`),
  which can never reach white. Most of the old ramp values were shifted
  nibbles, so restoring them properly expanded changes the expansion rather
  than the colour.
- `AssetColourBudget.ChannelBits`/`IsOnGrid` and `AssetSet.Load` enforce it
  at startup for both the named palette and every bitmap pixel, failing
  with the offending asset and colour named. Separate from the existing
  `PaletteNamesEveryColour` rule, which stays false for 16-bit — the tier
  is direct-colour, so a bitmap need not use a *named* colour, only a
  *producible* one. The 8-bit tier keeps 8 bits per channel and is
  unaffected.
- 36 colours across the 16-bit bitmaps were repainted onto the grid, mostly
  `elitetext.bmp`'s anti-aliased grey ramp and `scanner.bmp`. Stunt Car
  Racer shares the tier, so its `menu.bmp` was repainted too; its palette
  was already compliant.

### Added (a way into Elite's mission screens, 2026-08-01)

- The five mission briefings were only reachable by playing the missions -
  the Constrictor brief wants a combat rating of Above Average, the Thargoid
  sequence the third galaxy and two particular planets - so checking their
  layout meant hours of play or a hand-edited save. With the new
  `ELITE_DEBUG_MISSIONS` environment variable set (to any value), Ctrl-M now
  cycles them: Constrictor brief, Constrictor debrief, the two Thargoid
  briefs, the Thargoid debrief, and round again.
- Gated at runtime rather than by `#if DEBUG`, following
  `ELITE_DEBUG_COMMANDER` and the conditional-compilation removal of issue
  #7, so the screens can be checked in a Release build too. Unset, Ctrl-M
  does nothing. Ctrl-modified because a bare M would fire from the
  commander-name screens, which take typed letters, and F12 - the obvious
  key - is already `GameHost`'s frame dump.
- The environment variables are now documented in tables rather than only in
  code comments, each where it belongs: the shared `GAME_KEY_SCRIPT` and
  `GAME_FRAME_DUMP_DIR` in the [main readme](README.md#environment-variables)
  alongside the shared engine config, and each game's own in its readme
  (`ELITE_LOG_LEVEL`, `ELITE_DEBUG_COMMANDER`, `ELITE_DEBUG_MISSIONS`;
  `SCR_LOG_LEVEL`), cross-linked both ways. Elite's key table gained the F12
  frame-dump row with them.
- Each jump sets the state the screen's own `Reset` tests for and lets that
  `Reset` run rather than forcing the screen in, so what is drawn is the
  screen the game draws - the briefing text chosen the usual way, and the
  Constrictor spawned in front of the player for the screen that shows it.
  They are cheats and leave the commander mid-mission: the last two also
  overwrite the docked planet's seed with the system the briefing expects.
  Documented in [docs/elite-readme.md](docs/elite-readme.md).
- `MissionJumpTests` drives the real game through `HeadlessGameHarness` and
  asserts each stage lands on the right screen showing the right briefing,
  so a drift between the jumps and the controllers' entry conditions fails
  the build. Verified live with `run-elite`, on and off.

### Fixed (the 100-polygon-per-frame cap, 2026-08-01)

- `PainterRenderer`, `ZBufferRenderer` and `WireframeRenderer` each held a
  fixed 100-entry polygon array and opened `Submit` with
  `if (_totalPolys == MAXPOLYS) { return; }` - no log, no counter. The cap
  came from The New Kind's `poly_chain` but was reachable here: with 20
  universe objects against models running to 29 faces, four Cobras and a
  station is already ~91 polygons before lasers or explosion debris, and
  whatever arrived after the hundredth was silently not drawn.
- The three now share `PolygonBuffer`, which starts at 128 entries and
  doubles on demand, so nothing is dropped. The buffer is reused frame to
  frame, so the growth settles at the busiest scene seen and stops
  allocating. `WireframeRenderer` was under the same cap and is fixed with
  them, so its hidden-line pass no longer loses surfaces from the depth
  prepass either.
- Covered by `PolygonRendererCapacityTests`, which submits 500 polygons in a
  frame and asserts every one reaches `IGraphics` - failing against the old
  cap - plus a second frame to check the count resets rather than the buffer
  shrinking.

### Fixed (camera-space backface culling for Elite's ships, 2026-07-31)

- `ShipBase.DrawModelFaces` decided backface culling from the *projected*
  outline, whose behind-camera points had been through `ProjectPoint`'s
  `if (vec.Z <= 0) { vec.Z = 1; }` depth clamp. A face straddling the camera
  plane therefore had meaningless screen X/Y feeding the winding test, so it
  could be culled or kept incorrectly - and the near-plane clip that runs
  afterwards cannot undo a cull already taken. Visible as faces flickering
  on and off as a ship passed close by.
- The cull now runs in camera space, against the face's own normal rotated
  into view: `dot(normal, pointOnFace) <= 0`. The normals are precomputed
  once per model by `FindFaceRoots`, which was already deriving plane
  normals for the decal-rooting pass, so this costs no extra per-frame work.
  The clamp remains only for the laser aim, where it is harmless.
- 2-point detail lines are culled too. The old winding test resolved
  `point2` back to `PointIndices[0]` for a face of fewer than three points,
  degenerating to `0 <= 0` so every detail line passed every frame whichever
  way it faced. A line has no normal of its own, so it now takes the normal
  of the face whose plane it lies in - the root `FindFaceRoots` already
  finds. This removes the stray stub that poked off the far side of a hull
  silhouette, where no geometry existed to depth-test it away.

### Added (hidden-line removal for wireframe, 2026-07-31)

- Wireframe still showed the missile's fins, and the wings on the Krait,
  Cougar and Cobras, through the hull. No cull can fix that: those are
  double-sided plates, two coplanar triangles wound opposite ways, so
  exactly one of each pair faces the camera from any angle and survives
  backface culling even when it sits behind the body. Culling removes
  surfaces facing *away*; it cannot remove surfaces facing you from behind
  something else, which on a convex hull is the same thing and on a hull
  with fins is not.
- `WireframeRenderer` now buffers the frame and draws it in two passes: a
  new `IGraphics.FillDepth` writes every surface into the depth buffer
  without drawing it, then the outlines are drawn depth-tested against it.
  Threaded through the existing depth-fill path in both backends with a
  `writeColor` flag rather than duplicating the triangle walk. 2-point
  detail lines are excluded from the first pass - they are not surfaces and
  occlude nothing.
- An edge lies exactly on the surface it bounds, so it ties with the depth
  that surface just wrote, and the two rasterisers sample the same plane at
  slightly different sub-pixel positions - the tie is decided by about a
  pixel's worth of depth gradient. No depth bias resolves this: one large
  enough for a near edge-on face (whose gradient is huge) is also larger
  than the gap between a wing and the hull behind it, so any value that
  kept an edge visible also let hidden ones leak. A fixed 1% and then a
  slope-scaled offset were both tried and both left visible dashing.
- Settled by identity instead of magnitude: `FillDepth` tags each pixel it
  wins with a surface id, and `DrawLineDepth` takes the id of the surface
  its edge belongs to, drawing over that surface however the depths
  compare. No bias at all. Zero means "no surface", which never matches, so
  `ZBufferRenderer` and the textured paths are unaffected. Ids are cleared
  with `ClearDepth`.
- Verified against a filled reference render of the same missile poses: the
  wireframe's visible edges match the visible face boundaries of the solid
  image exactly, with nothing crossing the body. `VisualDumpTests` gained
  the missile dumps, wireframe and solid, since this is the model that
  exercises it hardest.

### Fixed (wireframe hidden-surface gaps: unrooted lines and lasers, 2026-07-31)

- Wireframe mode still showed hull detail lines and laser bolts through the
  hull. `WireframeRenderer` has no depth buffer at all and does no ordering
  - deliberately, since outlines are order-independent - so the backface
  cull is its *only* hidden-surface mechanism, and two things were escaping
  it. In solid mode the per-pixel depth test had been masking both.
- A detail line lying in no other face's plane has no root, so it had no
  normal to be culled against and drew unconditionally. It is now culled by
  the normals its two ends *share*: the model already records, per vertex,
  the faces that vertex belongs to (the `pn` entries, previously read only
  by the explosion debris effect), and the faces a line runs along are those
  common to both its ends. The line draws when any of them faces the camera,
  which is how the original decided a line's visibility. A line whose ends
  share none - a model carrying no such data - still draws, so this cannot
  silently remove detail.
- The laser bypassed the face loop entirely and was never culled. The bolt
  springs from a mount on the hull, so it now draws only when that vertex is
  visible by the same test, and a ship firing away from the viewer no longer
  paints a bolt through its own hull.
- Both rules fall back to drawing when the model carries no normals for the
  vertices in question, which is what the existing `ShipBase` transform and
  laser tests rely on; four new theory cases cover the culled and kept
  directions for each. Verified live via `run-elite` in wireframe (the stray
  stub on the Cobra Mk3 is gone, silhouettes are clean) and re-checked in
  solid mode for lost detail.

### Fixed (real per-vertex depth for Elite's z-buffer, 2026-07-31)

- Elite's z-buffered mode never actually got per-vertex depth.
  `ZBufferRenderer.Submit` filled every entry of a polygon's `Depths` array
  with the single flat whole-face key it was handed, so
  `DrawPolygonFilledDepth` interpolated a constant across each triangle and
  the per-pixel test resolved at whole-polygon granularity - no better than
  the painter's chain on the interpenetrating and steeply-angled faces a
  depth buffer exists to solve. SCR was already feeding real per-vertex
  depth straight to `IGraphics`; Elite was the side that wasn't.
- `IPolygonRenderer.Submit` (and `IEliteDraw.DrawPolygonFilled` behind it)
  now takes the camera-space depth of each point alongside the flat key.
  `ShipBase.BuildFacePolygon` emits the near-plane-clipped `Z` per vertex,
  which is the value it was already computing and discarding.
  `PainterRenderer` and `WireframeRenderer` ignore the new argument; the
  flat key stays because the painter's chain still sorts by it.
- `ZBufferRenderer`'s O(n²) insertion sort into a back-to-front linked chain
  is gone. It sorted whole polygons and *then* depth-tested every pixel;
  with a real per-pixel test the sort was dead work. Polygons now draw in
  submission order. `PainterRenderer` keeps its chain, which is the whole of
  what it does.
- Decals needed a bias. Cockpit windows and engine plates lie exactly in the
  plane of the hull face beneath, so per-vertex depth makes them tie pixel
  for pixel rather than merely share a key, and the rasteriser's scanline
  interpolation of inverse depth from floored pixel positions makes that tie
  inexact - the hull speckles through. Faces that `FindFaceRoots` roots to
  an earlier plane are now pulled 1% of their depth nearer. 0.1% was
  measured live as too small to cover the interpolation error on a near
  edge-on decal; 1% covers it and stays far inside the front-to-back spread
  of a single ship.
- `PainterAndZBufferRenderIdenticallyForNonDecalGeometry` became
  `PainterAndZBufferAgreeOnSilhouetteForNonDecalGeometry`. The two
  strategies are no longer pixel-identical on a convex decal-free model:
  the z-buffer awards a shared edge to the nearer face even when it is drawn
  first, where the painter's later face simply paints over it. The
  silhouette is still exactly equal, and the seam pixels are ~1% of the
  covered area.
- Lines are depth-tested now too, via a new `IGraphics.DrawLineDepth`
  implemented in both backends (`SoftwareGraphics.DrawLineIntDepth`,
  `SDLGraphics.DrawLineDepthToLayer` — Bresenham interpolating inverse
  depth by fraction of the major axis, mirroring the span fills).
  `ZBufferRenderer` routes its 2-point submissions through it. Previously
  every line — model detail lines and the laser bolt — went to the plain
  `DrawLine` and wrote pixels unconditionally, so hull detail on the far
  side of a ship drew straight through the hull. Dropping the back-to-front
  chain removed the accidental ordering that had been partly masking this,
  which is why it is fixed here rather than filed. `PainterRenderer` keeps
  plain `DrawLine`, which is correct for it — the chain is its ordering.
- Detail lines take the decal bias for the same reason decals do, and the
  laser bolt takes it at its mount: the bolt's far end is a screen-space
  viewport-boundary point with no camera depth of its own, so the whole
  line tests at the mount's biased depth — it cannot be swallowed by the
  hull it springs from, but anything genuinely in front still hides it.
- Verified live via `run-elite` against the same poses rendered in
  painter's mode: decal panels render solid at every angle including near
  edge-on, no faces flicker or drop out, and no detail line draws across a
  hull face any more.
- Left open, and filed in [backlog-issues.md](docs/backlog-issues.md): a
  2-point face never gets backface-culled, because the winding test
  resolves its third point back to its first and degenerates to `0 <= 0`.
  Depth testing hides such a line where it crosses the hull, but the part
  projecting outside the silhouette has nothing to occlude it and still
  shows as a stray line off the hull edge.

### Changed (shared near-plane clipping, 2026-07-31)

- `Scene3D.ClipPolygonToNearPlane` moved out of SCR into
  `SharpKind.Graphics.NearPlaneClip.Clip`
  ([NearPlaneClip.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.Graphics/NearPlaneClip.cs)). Both
  overloads (plain, and the one interpolating texture coordinates) were
  already pure static Sutherland-Hodgman with no SCR dependencies; the plane
  distance is now a parameter rather than a constant, because the two games
  work in different camera units. SCR passes its own `Scene3D.NearPlane`
  (0.5 track units) and is otherwise unchanged. The three clipping tests
  moved from `Scene3DTests` to a new `NearPlaneClipTests`, joined by two
  covering the texture-coordinate overload and a non-default plane.
- Elite adopted it: `ShipBase` used to force `vec.Z = 1` on any transformed
  point at or behind the camera, which does not clip the geometry so much as
  drag the offending vertex onto the camera plane - a face crossing that
  plane was drawn with a smeared, wrong-shaped outline. Ship faces are now
  clipped properly: `TransformModelPoints` keeps the camera-space points
  alongside the projected ones, and each face is clipped against a near
  plane of 1 unit and projected from the clipped result. A face entirely
  behind the plane is now dropped rather than drawn as garbage.
- Two things deliberately keep the old clamp. The backface-winding test and
  the laser aim both read projected points directly and need *some* value
  for a point behind the camera, so their behaviour is unchanged; and a
  2-point detail line is not a polygon, so feeding it to a cyclic clipper
  would walk its single edge twice. Faces of three points or more - which is
  every filled surface - go through the clipper.
- Verified live in both games via `run-elite`/`run-scr`: Elite's ship parade
  across a full close approach (the case that crosses the camera plane) and
  the flight views, and an SCR race where the road still reaches the bottom
  of the viewport uncut.

### Added (startup diagnostics shared by both games, 2026-07-31)

- `GameApp.Run` ([GameApp.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.App/GameApp.cs)) now logs
  two facts right after "Starting {title}", once per process, so a bug
  report's log file carries what fixing it usually needs first without
  asking the reporter for their machine spec or config: the build's
  informational version (from `AssemblyInformationalVersionAttribute`, i.e.
  MinVer's git-derived version), OS description, .NET runtime, process
  architecture and logical processor count (`LogMessages.SystemInfo`); and
  the engine settings actually in effect - backend, tier, window scale, fps,
  graphic style, depth sort, and the sound toggles
  (`LogMessages.EngineSettings`). Both are logged from the one shared call
  site both `SDLProgram.cs`s already route through, so Elite and SCR get it
  identically with no per-game code.
- Both lines are a single JSON object (`System.Text.Json`-serialized) rather
  than a prose sentence, so the two facts can be machine-parsed back out of
  the log file, e.g.
  `{"backend":"Software","tier":"SixteenBit","windowScale":1,"fps":60,...}`.
  The message template uses Serilog's `:l` (literal) format specifier on the
  JSON string - without it the sink would additionally quote-and-escape the
  whole blob, same as it already does for any plain string property.
  Verified live in both `elite-.log` and `scr-.log` via `run-elite`/`run-scr`.

### Removed (last conditional compilation site in Elite, 2026-07-31)

- `SaveFile`'s `#if DEBUG` (issue #7) picked `CommanderFactory.Max()` as the
  starting commander in debug builds and `.Jameson()` otherwise, so trying
  the debug commander meant a debug build. It's now a runtime check against
  a new `ELITE_DEBUG_COMMANDER` environment variable (presence-checked, same
  convention as `SharpKind.Abstraction.GameHost`'s `GAME_KEY_SCRIPT`/
  `GAME_FRAME_DUMP_DIR`), so `Jameson()` is the default in every build and
  `Max()` is an opt-in without recompiling. The other site the backlog item
  named, a commented-out `////#if QHD` block in `SDLProgram.cs`, had already
  been deleted by an earlier change; the item was stale on that half.
- `SaveFile` also logs the outcome at startup (new
  `LogMessages.DebugCommanderEnvVar`, Information level so it shows with
  the default log config): `elite-.log` now records whether
  `ELITE_DEBUG_COMMANDER` was set and which commander it started with,
  e.g. `ELITE_DEBUG_COMMANDER is set; starting commander is MAX.` -
  verified live against both branches with `run-elite`.

### Fixed (a missing sound effect no longer throws, 2026-07-31)

- `AudioController.PlayEffect` looked its sample up with an unguarded
  dictionary indexer, so an effect name absent from the sample dictionary
  threw `KeyNotFoundException` out of whatever gameplay code asked for the
  sound. It now uses `TryGetValue` and logs a Warning no-op instead, via a
  new `SharpKind.Audio.LogMessages.MissingSfxSample` following the same
  `[LoggerMessage]` pattern as `SharpKind.Graphics`.
- The logger reaches it through a second constructor taking `ILogger?`
  (the existing three-argument one delegates with `null`, so tests and any
  other caller are unchanged); Elite's DI registration passes a real
  logger. The practical effect is that a test constructing an
  `AudioController` only has to populate the effects it actually cares
  about — `EffectsOn` defaults true, so previously every effect the code
  under test happened to trigger had to be present.

### Fixed (sdl-drive key names, 2026-07-31)

- `drive.ps1`'s `ConvertTo-VirtualKeyCode` had no entry for `Return`, so a
  `key:Return` step threw "Unknown key name" (hit while driving SCR's
  menus). `Return` is now an alias of the existing `Enter`, and `Tab` and
  `Back`/`Backspace` were added alongside it as the other obvious
  omissions.

### Fixed (one word-wrap, two off-by-ones, 2026-07-31)

- The line breaking that `BaseView8Bit` and `BaseView16Bit` each had a
  copy of is now `Views/TextWrap.Split`, which returns rows rather than
  drawing them. `DrawTextPretty` draws those rows left-aligned; the 8-bit
  options screen centres the same rows and stacks them upwards from the
  bottom of the viewport, which is why it kept a wrapper of its own and no
  longer has to. Splitting rather than sharing the drawing is what let one
  helper serve both.
- Text that already fitted was broken anyway: the break scan clamped to
  the last index of the string instead of noticing the remainder fit, so a
  40-character string on a 40-character row came out as two rows.
- A row ending in a comma or period could run one character past its
  width. The scan started at the first character *past* the row rather
  than the last one on it, so a break there put the punctuation on a row
  already full. Narrowing it shifts wrapped 16-bit mission text slightly.
- A space at the break is dropped rather than kept on the row it ends. It
  drew nothing left-aligned, but it pushed a centred row half a character
  off centre.

### Changed (ViewLayout becomes the viewport, and 8-bit text gets a grid, 2026-07-31)

- The screen border was a pixel short on the right: `DrawRectangle` draws
  its far edge at `position + size - 1`, so passing `ScreenWidth - 1` lost
  the last column. It now touches both edges.
- `ViewLayout` describes one region, the viewport — everything above the
  HUD — starting at the screen origin. `BorderWidth`, `ScannerTop`,
  `ScannerLeft`, `ScannerRight` and `Offset` are gone; `Offset` duplicated
  `ScannerLeft` exactly, and both tiers' scanners being full-width meant
  the scanner members were screen edges under another name. See
  [decisions.md](docs/decisions.md).
- The border is drawn over the viewport's outer pixel rather than reserved
  out of it, so its width no longer moves any view, and each screen draws
  it in its own `Draw` instead of `EliteMain.Update` doing it once a tick.
- The 8-bit viewport is exactly 40x25 of its 8x8 character cells, and
  8-bit text is positioned with `Row(n)`/`Column(n)`, `DrawTextCentreOnGrid`
  and `SnapToGrid` rather than pixel constants. Row 0 and the outermost
  columns belong to the border, so the chrome band is row 1, the header
  rule row 2, and screen content starts at row 3. The header's yellow
  verticals down to the scanner are gone on both tiers.
- The FPS overlay is an engine config option, `engine.graphics.showFps`
  (off by default), rather than a `#if DEBUG` gate that Release could
  never show and Debug could never hide. It, the hyperspace countdown and
  the in-flight message are per-tier chrome on `IBaseView` now, not
  `EliteMain`'s own drawing.
- `ShortRangeChartViewBase` — the last screen combining controller and
  view — is split into `ShortRangeChartController`/`ShortRangeChartModel`
  with per-tier views. Its model carries screen positions rather than
  galaxy space, because the row packing decides which planets get a name
  and the blob sizes depend on the `CarryFlag` side effect of naming;
  keeping both in the controller is what the backlog entry preferred.

### Changed (FastColor's implicit conversions removed, 2026-07-30)

- Phase 4, closing out the colour-handling unification: the implicit
  `uint`↔`FastColor` conversions added in phase 1 are gone, so the
  boundary is now explicit wherever one still exists. Rather than cast at
  each call site — which would have put the conversion noise inside the
  render inner loops the earlier phases had deliberately kept clean — the
  type flows end to end instead: `FastBitmap.GetPixel` returns `FastColor`
  (the backing store stays `uint[]` for memalloc) and the redundant
  `SetPixel(.., in uint)` overload goes; `BitmapFont.Ink`/`Background`,
  `SoftwareGraphics`' private helpers and the ~110 Elite and SCR colour
  fields phase 3 had left on `uint` all become `FastColor`. Alpha tests
  read `color.A != 0` rather than masking with `0xFF000000`.
- Two places keep `uint` deliberately: `AssetSet`'s colour-budget
  bookkeeping does set arithmetic and sorts with `Order()`, which
  `FastColor` does not support, and `SDLGraphics` keys its text-texture
  cache on the raw ARGB.
- `PlanetRenderer.Landscape` was doing double duty — the fractal
  midpoint-displacement pass filled it with heights, `ColorLandscape`
  overwrote it in place with colours, and the renderer drew it as pixels.
  That cannot survive typing, since heights are averaged arithmetically
  and colours are not, so `FractalPlanet` now owns a private `uint[,]`
  height map and `Landscape` is the `FastColor` buffer it always was at
  draw time. Behaviour is unchanged; the per-seed determinism test still
  passes.
- The two `FastColorTests` covering the deleted operators now exercise
  `FromUInt32`/`ToUInt32` instead, so the round trip stays covered.

### Changed (The 8-bit palette becomes sixteen web colours, 2026-07-30)

- `Palette/EightBit/palette.json` is now sixteen CSS colour names at their
  exact web values, replacing the 29 inherited ramp names. The rationale,
  including why `DimGray` displaced `Magenta` and why these keep the CSS
  `Gray` spelling against the repo's UK standard, is in
  [decisions.md](docs/decisions.md).
- The 14 8-bit bitmaps were repainted onto those sixteen colours
  (maintainer). Transparency is carried by a 32bpp alpha channel at
  `00000000` — indexed and 24bpp BMP cannot express it, since
  `BitmapReader` forces those opaque, so the sprites that need a
  transparent background are 32bpp and the rest stay indexed.
- Every `Palette["..."]` lookup on the 8-bit path moved with it: `Gold` to
  `Yellow`, `LightRed` to `Red`, `LighterRed` to `Orange`, `LightGrey` to
  `LightGray`, across 13 views.

### Added (Models are tier-scoped, 2026-07-30)

- `Assets/Models/` splits into `EightBit/` and `SixteenBit/`. Geometry is
  resolution-independent, but colour is not: `ModelReader` resolves each
  `usemtl` through the active palette, and 13 of the 21 material names the
  ships use stopped existing at 8-bit.
- The 8-bit copies' ~380 `usemtl` lines were rewritten onto the web names.
  The grey ramp maps onto five neutral steps by luminance — `LighterGrey`
  to `White` (255), `LightGrey` to `LightGray` (211), `Grey` to `DarkGray`
  (169), `DarkGrey` to `Gray` (128), `DarkerGrey` to `DimGray` (105) —
  deliberately stopping short of `Black`, which would render 48 faces as
  holes against space.
- `AssetLocator.ModelPaths` uses `TierPath` like the other tier-varying
  categories; `Models` is no longer tier-neutral.
- Each tier's folder gains a `palette.mtl` generated from its own
  `palette.json`. The game ignores it, but the `.obj` files declare
  `mtllib palette.mtl` and would otherwise open with missing materials in
  external tools.

### Added (8-bit bitmaps must only use palette colours, 2026-07-30)

- Loading an asset set now checks that every opaque colour in its bitmaps
  is one the palette names, and fails startup naming the offending files
  and colours. Previously nothing tied art and palette together, and only
  the combined colour count would notice, and only once it crossed the cap.
- The rule applies to `EightBit` and not `SixteenBit`, following the
  hardware each tier stands in for: 8-bit machines were indexed-colour, so
  an unnamed bitmap colour is one the machine could not have shown, while
  16-bit is direct-colour and its palette only names colours the geometry
  draws with. `AssetColourBudget.PaletteNamesEveryColour` carries the
  distinction, beside `MaxColours`.
- It is a subset test, not equality, and transparent pixels are excluded —
  as they are from the colour cap.

### Changed (Nothing that draws is shared between tiers, 2026-07-30)

- `ViewLayout` holds the tier's screen metrics, derived from a screen size,
  the scanner art's size and the coordinate scale rather than stored, so no
  two can disagree. `IEliteDraw` exposes it and no longer carries its own
  `Top`/`Left`/`Centre`/`Scale`/`Scanner*` — those had become a second
  spelling of the same values.
- `IBaseView` with `BaseView8Bit`/`BaseView16Bit` holds the chrome every
  screen shares: `DrawViewHeader`, `DrawTextPretty`, `DrawBorder` and
  `DrawHyperspaceCountdown`. The last two came off `EliteDraw`, which no
  longer draws any chrome; `EliteMain` calls them through the base view.
- `Scanner`, `LaserDraw`, `GradientSun` and `StripedPlanet` each split into
  a base holding the logic and per-tier subclasses holding the colours and
  positions. `Scanner` is the substantial one: ~20 offsets hardcoded to the
  512x129 scanner became named members, so each tier's art sets its own HUD
  layout.
- `ShortRangeChartView` splits into `ShortRangeChartViewBase` plus per-tier
  views. Its cross-hair clamps, previously the literals 510 and 339, are a
  per-tier `CrossBounds`.
- `IEliteDraw.Tier` lets `PlanetFactory` and `SunFactory` pick a renderer;
  the rest resolve per-tier through DI. `IsEightBit` is one shared helper
  rather than three copies.

### Fixed (16-bit HUD after the 640x512 widening, 2026-07-30)

- The 16-bit scanner art is 640x129. Comparing it against the 512-wide
  version shows it was re-laid-out rather than stretched: the left dial
  panel did not move (its edge is at x=97-100 in both), the radar's centre
  line moved half the increase (253 to 317), and everything from the
  compass rightwards moved the full 128 — the right panel's edge 411 to
  539, and the compass ring's centre 386.5 to 514.5.
- `Scanner16Bit`'s right-hand cluster is +128 accordingly, which puts the
  energy banks back inside their numbered boxes and the speed, roll and
  climb indicators back in the SP/RL/DC panel instead of over the radar.
  `ScannerCentre` needed no change: it derives from `ViewLayout.Centre`.

### Added (A view per tier for every screen, 2026-07-30)

- Every screen now has both an 8-bit and a 16-bit view, in a folder and
  under a name that says which tier it is: the 18 existing views moved to
  `Views/SixteenBit/<Screen>View16Bit.cs` (namespace
  `EliteSharpLib.Views.SixteenBit`), matching the `Views/EightBit/`
  convention that the first 8-bit views established.
- Nine new 8-bit views complete the set: `GalacticChartView8Bit`,
  `QuitView8Bit`, `Intro1View8Bit`, `Intro2View8Bit`,
  `EscapeCapsuleView8Bit`, `GameOverView8Bit`, `OptionsView8Bit`,
  `SettingsListView8Bit` and `PilotView8Bit`. The earlier survey had
  called several of these "no second class needed" because their layout
  is already `Centre`/`ScannerTop`-relative; a view per tier per screen
  is now the rule regardless, so each tier's spacing constants can be
  authored independently instead of one set serving both.
- All 18 `IView<TModel>` registrations branch on
  `IAssetLocator.Tier` via the existing `IsEightBit(sp)` helper.
- `SettingsListView8Bit` keeps the two-column grid rather than dropping
  to one, even though a name and its value do not fit side by side at
  40 characters: the shared `SettingsListController`'s cursor moves in
  steps of two, so a single visual column would make Up/Down look like
  it skipped a row. Each cell stacks its value under its name instead.
- `OptionsView8Bit` word-wraps the credits itself. `IEliteDraw.DrawTextPretty`
  was tried first and is unusable here - it breaks text that already fits
  (its `i += maxlen` then clamp-to-`Length - 1` always finds a break point)
  and draws left-aligned where these lines are centred. Backlogged.
- The DI registrations split again, into a second static class
  (`EliteSplitAnimatedScreensServiceCollectionExtensions`, holding the
  sequence and flight screens): nine more view types took
  `EliteSplitScreensServiceCollectionExtensions` to 102 coupled types
  against CA1506's class limit of 96. Splitting a method could not fix
  it this time, since that metric is per class.
- The durable rules from this and the preceding controller/view work now
  live in [architecture-principles.md](docs/architecture-principles.md)
  under "Screens: controllers, models and per-tier views", and the
  backlog's tier-presentation section is down to the three items still
  open. Verified by build, the full test suite, and screenshotting the
  new 8-bit views live (title screen, ship parade, galactic chart,
  options, game settings, engine settings, quit, front view);
  `GameOverView8Bit` and `EscapeCapsuleView8Bit` are single centred
  lines and were not driven to on screen.

### Added (8-bit views for every absolute-layout screen, 2026-07-30)

- `InventoryView8Bit`, `MarketView8Bit`, `EquipmentView8Bit`,
  `PlanetDataView8Bit`, `ConstrictorMissionView8Bit`,
  `ThargoidMissionView8Bit`, `LoadCommanderView8Bit` and
  `SaveCommanderView8Bit` (`Views/EightBit/`), each wired through the
  same `IsEightBit(sp) ? ... : ...` DI pattern `CommanderStatusView8Bit`
  established. These are first-draft layouts (build, render, no
  obvious overflow, checked once per screen) rather than
  worst-case-verified ones - the maintainer is taking the spacing
  judgement over from here.
- `PilotView`'s one absolute coordinate needed no second class: its
  hardcoded `y=358` was always just the 16-bit `ScannerTop - 25`
  (383-25=358), so it now reads `_draw.ScannerTop - 25` and serves both
  tiers unchanged.
- `MarketView8Bit` drops the 16-bit view's separate "Unit" column
  (folded into the quantity text, e.g. `"20t"`) since five columns
  does not fit 320px/8px-per-character.
- `AddSplitConsoleScreens` split again, into `AddSplitStatusScreens`
  (`CommanderStatus`/`Inventory`/`PlanetData`), after the second and
  third 8-bit view tripped CA1506's per-method limit a second time.

### Added (First 8-bit view authored: CommanderStatus, 2026-07-30)

- `CommanderStatusView8Bit` (`Views/EightBit/`), a fresh 320x256 layout
  for the commander status screen rather than a scaled-down version of
  the 16-bit one, since the two tiers' fonts aren't proportional (8-bit
  is a fixed 8x8 grid; 16-bit is proportional at up to 32px). The
  `IView<CommanderStatusModel>` DI registration now branches on
  `IAssetLocator.Tier` via a new `IsEightBit(IServiceProvider)` helper,
  which exists specifically to keep `IAssetLocator`/`SystemTier` off
  every such registration's own CA1506 class-coupling count - inlining
  the check tripped `AddSplitConsoleScreens`'s limit on the first
  screen.
- The 8-bit layout uses one equipment column where 16-bit uses two:
  at 320px/8px-per-character the widest realistic string ("Front
  Military Laser", from a maxed-out laser loadout) already needs more
  than half the screen's width, and the column wrap point is
  positional rather than content-aware, so two columns wide enough for
  that string cannot fit side-by-side. Row pitch is tightened to 8px
  (no gap, matching the font exactly) so all four laser mounts plus
  every other upgrade - checked as the worst case, not just whatever a
  starting commander happens to show - fits above the scanner with
  only the single most extreme case landing a few pixels tight.
- Corrected a stale backlog claim in passing: "the 8-bit tier is
  already the maintainer's configured default" was checked against the
  actual `elite.sharp` config and found false (it's `SixteenBit`);
  verifying an 8-bit layout requires temporarily editing that file.

### Changed (Tier presentation follow-on decisions, 2026-07-30)

Documentation only - no code changes. Resolves the two items left after
the controller/view split, both of which were decisions blocking the
next implementation work rather than code to write.

- Dropped the "retire the pass-through controllers" step outright.
  `DockingView`/`HyperspaceView`/`LaunchView` are the only three left
  of the six it named, and all three draw through a shared
  `BreakPattern` that takes no model and is already resolution-
  independent - there is nothing to extract into a controller/model/
  view triple, so they stay plain `IScreenController` implementations.
- Surveyed every converted screen's `Draw` method and bucketed each
  one: absolute-layout screens that need a fresh 8-bit view (ten of
  them, including `PilotView` for one hardcoded line even though its
  view-name text is otherwise resolution-independent), derived-layout
  screens where a tier-specific spacing constant (or nothing at all)
  will do, and `GalacticChartView` as the strongest candidate for
  needing no second class at all, since its `ToScreen` conversion is
  entirely `Scale`/`Offset`-driven already. Full breakdown in the
  backlog.

### Changed (Controller/view split complete, the design-questions group, 2026-07-30)

- `Intro2`, the four cockpit windows and `PlanetData` each become a
  controller, a model record and a drawing-only view. Every
  behaviour-bearing screen is now split except `ShortRangeChart`, which
  stays deliberately out of scope.
- The `PilotView` family was never inheritance despite how the backlog
  described it - `PilotFrontView`/`PilotRearView`/`PilotLeftView`/
  `PilotRightView` were four near-identical classes composing their own
  instance of the same `PilotView`, differing only in a view-name
  string, which laser mount to draw and which starfield direction to
  scroll. Collapsed into one `PilotController` parameterised by a new
  `PilotDirection` enum, sharing one `IView<PilotModel>` registration
  across all four screens - the largest structural change so far,
  deleting four files rather than splitting one. `PopulateScreens`
  constructs the four `PilotController` instances directly
  (`CreatePilotController`), since a single `AddSingleton<PilotController>()`
  registration can only ever serve one screen.
- `Intro2` and `PlanetData` had none of the layout/content entanglement
  the backlog worried about: `Intro2View.Draw()` never touched the
  parade ship itself (drawn by the universe, like `Intro1`'s rolling
  Cobra), and `PlanetDataView`'s fixed y-coordinates never depended on
  which content was selected, unlike `ShortRangeChartView`'s row
  packing. Both converted the same mechanical way as every screen
  before them.
- `LaserDraw` (the crosshair/beam renderer, now constructed by
  `PilotView` instead of the old shared `PilotView` behaviour class)
  takes `RNG` for cosmetic beam jitter only, so it stayed on the view
  side rather than the controller, unlike this codebase's usual pattern
  of keeping `RNG` on the controller (e.g. `GameOverController`'s cargo
  scatter).
- New controller tests: `Intro2ControllerTests`, `PilotControllerTests`,
  `PlanetDataControllerTests`.

### Changed (Controller/view split, the text-entry group, 2026-07-30)

- `LoadCommander` and `SaveCommander` each become a controller, a model
  record and a drawing-only view. Sixteen screens are now split, with
  three items left on the backlog's list.
- Kept as two independent view classes rather than one shared view like
  `SettingsListView`: `SettingsListView`'s sharing came from code that
  was already one class before conversion, but Load and Save were
  always separate, and `SaveCommanderView` draws its name box with
  `DrawRectangle` at an explicit position where `LoadCommanderView`
  uses `DrawRectangleCentre` - each view keeps its own original call
  rather than assuming the two are pixel-identical.
- The "Press SPACE to continue." footer is hardcoded in both views
  rather than carried in the model, matching the existing precedent in
  `ThargoidMissionView`/`ConstrictorMissionView` for this exact
  recurring phrase. The screen-specific headline text ("Error Loading
  Commander!", "Commander Saved.", "Error Saving Commander!") is
  content and does go through the model.
- New controller tests type through the same `IKeyboard` fake the real
  input goes through, which caught that typed input can only ever be
  upper-case (`HandleInput` only recognises `ConsoleKey.A`-`Z`, and
  there is no lower-case equivalent) - the first draft of the tests
  used mixed-case names and silently failed to type the lower-case
  letters.

### Changed (Controller/view split, the selection-cursor group, 2026-07-30)

- `Options`, `Market`, `Equipment`, `Settings` and `EngineSettings` each
  become a controller, a model record and a drawing-only view.
  Fourteen screens are now split, with five items left on the backlog's
  list.
- `SettingsListController`/`SettingsListView` replace the old abstract
  `SettingsListView`: the abstract base keeps the shared cursor and
  navigation, and one `SettingsListView` (now drawing-only) is shared by
  both `SettingsController` and `EngineSettingsController` via a single
  `IView<SettingsListModel>` registration - the first split screen where
  a view is shared across controllers rather than paired 1:1. The two
  concrete files are renamed to match (`SettingsController.cs`,
  `EngineSettingsController.cs`); their existing behaviour tests moved
  with them (`SettingsControllerTests`, `EngineSettingsControllerTests`,
  `SettingsControllerFixture`), otherwise unchanged.
- `MarketController`'s cursor bug is fixed: `StockType` starts at 1
  (`Food`), but the cursor was a plain `int` clamped to `[0, Count-1]`,
  so reset left nothing highlighted (position 0 is `StockType.None`)
  and the last row (`AlienItems`) could never be reached. The clamp is
  now `[1, Count]` and `Reset` starts on `StockType.Food`;
  `MarketControllerTests` covers the first and last row.
- Padding/alignment format specifiers stayed in the views even where the
  underlying number is content, e.g. `MarketRow.ForSaleQuantity` and
  `MarketModel.Cash` are raw numbers because the original right-aligned
  them to a fixed column width - a layout concern. `EquipmentModel.Cash`
  by contrast is a fully-formatted string, matching
  `CommanderStatusModel.Cash`'s precedent, because the original drew it
  as one indivisible line with no alignment trick.
- DI registrations for split screens moved to their own class,
  `EliteSplitScreensServiceCollectionExtensions`, and gained a third
  method, `AddSplitMenuScreens`: adding the five screens first tripped
  the per-method CA1506 limit again, and then - once corrected - tripped
  the *class*-level CA1506 limit on `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions`
  itself (96 coupled types), which the new class resolves since the
  metric is computed per class.
- New controller tests: `OptionsControllerTests`,
  `MarketControllerTests`, `EquipmentControllerTests`.

### Changed (Controller/view split, the mechanical three, 2026-07-30)

- `GameOver`, `EscapeCapsule` and `ConstrictorMission` each become a
  controller, a model record and a drawing-only view. Nine of the
  eighteen behaviour-bearing screens are now split — half way.
- The animation counters the backlog named are now controller state,
  and renamed `_i` to `_tick` on the way: a controller that no longer
  draws has no loop for `_i` to belong to. `EscapeCapsule` publishes
  `IsAlertVisible` rather than the count, so neither tier's view owns a
  timer and both stop showing the alert on the same tick.
- `ConstrictorMission` mirrors `ThargoidMission` exactly, down to
  keying the view's layout off the model's stage. Which of the two
  second paragraphs the galaxy selects is now the controller's
  decision, so it is testable without a renderer.
- `AddSplitScreens` split into `AddSplitConsoleScreens` and
  `AddSplitSequenceScreens`. Adding the three tripped CA1506 at 49
  coupled types, which is what the method's own comment had predicted;
  the halves leave headroom for the nine screens still to convert.
- `ConstrictorMissionControllerTests` covers the stage selection, both
  galaxy variants and the debrief bounty; `EscapeCapsuleControllerTests`
  pins the alert lapsing on tick 90 rather than 89.

### Changed (Controller/view split, five more screens, 2026-07-29)

- `Quit`, `ThargoidMission`, `Intro1`, `CommanderStatus` and
  `Inventory` each become a controller, a model record and a
  drawing-only view, joining the galactic chart below. Six of the
  eighteen behaviour-bearing screens are now split.
- `CommanderStatus` is the archetype: its ratings table, condition,
  legal-status banding and equipment list move to the controller,
  leaving the view with the x=16/x=200 label columns that the 8-bit
  layout will re-author. `Inventory` and `CommanderStatus` have no
  input of their own but plenty of formatting, which is why they were
  converted here rather than left as drawing-only screens — otherwise
  each tier's view would re-derive the same strings.
- Every screen draws through `IView<TModel>`. A parameterless `IView`
  was added for screens with input but no data and removed the same
  day: two screens needed it at once and a single registration can only
  serve one, so the second would have silently displaced the first. A
  screen's fixed wording is content rather than layout, so it belongs
  in a model like everything else.
- `ShortRangeChart` is deliberately not converted. Its `Reset`
  entangles text-row packing with which planets are drawn at all, and
  blob size depends on `CarryFlag`, a side effect of the name
  generation that only runs when a name wins a free row. See the
  backlog for the decision and the shape to revisit it with.
- `CommanderStatusControllerTests` covers the rating bands, condition,
  legal-status bands, the witchspace blank and the equipment list -
  all without a renderer.

### Changed (Controller/view seam, galactic chart, 2026-07-29)

- First step of the tier presentation architecture: a screen's
  behaviour and its layout are now separable, so a per-tier view can
  vary the layout without duplicating the behaviour.
- `IView` (`Reset`/`Update`/`Draw`/`HandleInput`) is renamed
  `IScreenController`, and `IView<TModel>` is the new drawing-only
  contract. Because the old interface was already exactly the
  controller shape, the 27 unconverted screens satisfy
  `IScreenController` unchanged and needed no transitional wrappers.
- `GalacticChartView` is split into `GalacticChartController` +
  `GalacticChartModel` + a drawing-only `GalacticChartView`. The
  controller works entirely in galaxy space - the raw (D, B) of a
  `GalaxySeed`, 0-255 per axis - and the view applies `Scale`/`Offset`,
  so nothing tier-specific remains on the behaviour side.
- `GameState.Cross` is gone. Chart cursor state was only ever read by
  the two chart screens, and storing it in screen pixels forced the
  round-trip through `Scale` that kept the behaviour tier-coupled. Each
  chart now owns its own cursor; the galactic chart's is in galaxy
  space, and `ShortRangeChartView` keeps a screen-space copy until it
  is converted.
- Cursor bounds move with it: the old 512-space clamps (x 1-510,
  y 37-293) become galaxy-space constants that reproduce them exactly
  at the 16-bit tier. At the 8-bit tier they are a deliberate change -
  the old screen-space clamps mapped to roughly twice the galaxy's
  extent there, letting the cursor leave the galaxy, and the step size
  was likewise doubled. Both now match the 16-bit tier.
- `GalacticChartControllerTests` covers the cursor stepping and
  clamping, the find-by-name prompt and the caption/detail formatting -
  none of it needing a renderer, which is the point of the model.

### Added (Config-driven logging, 2026-07-29)

- `engine.logging` gains `minimumLevel` and `retainedFileCount`,
  replacing the two values previously hardcoded in
  `GameApp.CreateSeriLogger`. The `ELITE_LOG_LEVEL`/`SCR_LOG_LEVEL`
  environment variables still override the level - the escape hatch
  for when the config file itself is what needs debugging.
- Solves the ordering problem note left on this item: reading the
  config needs a logger, but the real logger needs the config's
  retained-file-count to be built correctly. `GameApp.Run` now reads
  the engine settings through a throwaway console-only bootstrap
  logger (whose level is already fully known from the environment
  variable alone) before building the one real logger the rest of the
  app uses, rather than building the real logger first and only
  patching its level afterwards.
- `GameApp.Run` takes a `readEngineSettings` delegate alongside
  `buildServices`, and `buildServices` now receives the already-read
  `EngineConfigSettings` instead of reading them again itself - both
  games' `SDLProgram.BuildServices` shrink accordingly.

### Added (Window scale, 2026-07-29)

- `engine.windowScale` magnifies the window without changing what is
  drawn: an integer, defaulting to 1, that both games multiply their
  render resolution by when creating the window. At scale 2 Elite's
  512x512 fills a 1024x1024 window with each pixel doubled, not with
  more of the scene. It is deliberately independent of `tier` — the
  tier chooses which machine's art and resolution the game reproduces,
  the scale only how large that appears on a modern display.
- The framebuffer stays native at any scale. Both backends already
  composed each frame into a fixed-size texture and blitted it to the
  window on every present, so the magnification is
  `SDL_SetRenderLogicalPresentation` in integer-scale mode on the
  renderer plus nearest-neighbour sampling on the two presented
  textures. Every drawing coordinate above that is logical-space and
  unchanged, so no game code knows the window size — and because
  logical presentation applies only when drawing to the window,
  `SDLGraphics`' render target and `SaveScreen` still work at the
  native resolution.
- Out-of-range scales are repaired like every other engine setting:
  zero, negative, or past 4 (larger than any display the game could be
  shown on) goes back to 1 rather than failing at startup.

### Added (SharpKind.App: one shared composition root, 2026-07-29)

- The two `SDLProgram.cs` files were about half duplicate: `Main` and
  `CreateSeriLogger` were identical between the games apart from four
  strings. They move to `GameApp.Run` in a new `SharpKind.App` assembly,
  which each `Main` now calls with its title, log file name, log-level
  environment variable and its own `BuildServices`. Everything left in
  the two files is genuinely game-specific.
- `SharpKind.App` is the app layer as an assembly rather than as a pair of
  entry points: it is the only place Serilog is referenced now (the two
  app projects drop their four Serilog package references and their
  duplicate `LogMessages`), and no game or engine library references it.
  `docs/architecture-principles.md` is updated to say so.
- `BuildServices` collapses too: the shared preamble - logger factory,
  the backend the config selects, the graphics/sound/keyboard it
  exposes, and the tier's asset locator - becomes
  `AddGameEngine(engine, width, height, title, loggerFactory)` in
  `SharpKind.App`. Each game's `BuildServices` is now its resolution, that
  one call, and its own three or four registrations. Stunt Car Racer
  gains `AddScrMain()` so its game registrations live in its own library
  as Elite's already did, rather than being spelled out in the app.
- Games gain `IGameApp` alongside `IGame` - `Run` for the composition
  root, `Update`/`Draw` for `GameHost`, kept as separate interfaces
  because they are separate roles.
- `Main` returns an exit code instead of the host calling
  `Environment.Exit`, so the container disposes its singletons on the
  way out of a failed start rather than the process vanishing mid-stack.
  This is what the principles already asked for; it only became
  enforceable once the code moved somewhere the analyser checks it.

### Changed (Engine settings read once, shared, 2026-07-29)

- Each game had its own `ReadBackend`, `ReadSystemTier` and
  `ReadWindowScale` for the composition root to call before the DI
  container exists, six methods with the same body between them - and
  each one opened, bound, repaired and possibly rewrote the whole config
  file for a single value. They collapse to one `ReadEngineSettings` per
  game returning the whole `EngineConfigSettings`, over a shared
  `EngineConfigReader.Read<TConfig>` in `SharpKind.Abstraction`. Startup now
  reads the file once instead of three times, and a new engine setting no
  longer means a new method in both games.
- `ConfigSettings<TGameSettings>` gains a non-generic `ConfigSettings`
  base holding the version, the engine settings and `Repair`. It is what
  lets the shared reader name a config type without knowing the game's
  own settings type; games still derive from the generic one.

### Changed (Stunt Car Racer selects its asset tier, 2026-07-29)

- Stunt Car Racer reads `engine.tier` from its config and builds its
  `AssetLocator` from it, as Elite already did. The tier was shared
  config the game simply ignored: every asset came from the default
  16-bit set whatever the file said.
- `ScrPalette` no longer creates an `AssetLocator` of its own. It takes
  an `IAssetLocator`, which the composition root supplies, so the
  palette follows the configured tier and the manifest is read once per
  run rather than once per construction. `StuntCarRacerMain` receives
  the locator alongside the abstraction to hand it on.
- The software backend now gets the same locator as the SDL one. It was
  falling through to the overload that makes its own, so under the
  default backend the tier would not have reached the assets even once
  it was read.
- Stunt Car Racer still ships only the 16-bit set, so selecting the
  8-bit tier fails at startup on the manifest's `Tiers` list rather
  than loading 16-bit art under an 8-bit label. The 8-bit assets
  themselves remain outstanding in the backlog.

### Changed (Config hardened before release, 2026-07-29)

- The file carries a `version` now. Nothing migrates yet - the point is
  that a later rename or restructure *can*, rather than being
  indistinguishable from a corrupt file. A file with no version reads
  as the current one, which is what every file written before this was.
- One value that cannot be honoured no longer costs the user the other
  twenty. `ConfigFile<T>`'s all-or-nothing `isValid` predicate is
  replaced by a `repair` hook that puts individual unusable values back
  to their defaults in place and reports whether it had to, and the
  settings either side of it survive. The limit is a value the JSON
  binder cannot parse at all (a misspelt enum name, a string where a
  number belongs) - that fails the whole bind, so the defaults still
  stand.
- A config file that is about to be rewritten as something other than
  what it held is first copied to `<name>.bad`, so a hand-edit that
  didn't parse is recoverable instead of being silently overwritten by
  the next settings change.
- Engine validation is shared. `EngineConfigSettings.Repair` checks the
  backend, tier, frame rate, graphic style and depth sort once for both
  games - Stunt Car Racer previously passed no validator at all, so a
  bad value there sat in the file until it broke something at startup.
- `polygonRenderMode` is renamed `depthSort` (as is the enum behind it,
  which never covered wireframe and so was never a "polygon render
  mode"), and `sound.musicOn` / `sound.effectsOn` become `sound.music`
  / `sound.effects` - inside a `sound` group the suffix said nothing.

### Added (A separate Engine Settings screen, 2026-07-29)

- The settings screen splits in two, along the same line as the config
  file. Game Settings keeps Elite's own (planet style, sun style,
  planet descriptions, instant dock); the new Engine Settings screen
  takes the shared ones (graphic style, depth sort, music, effects).
  Both are reached from the Options screen; the F-keys are left as the
  original had them.
- The backend and the tier are on it too, marked `*` against a
  "Applies when the game is restarted" footer: both are read before the
  container is built, so the screen saves the choice and the next
  launch acts on it rather than pretending it took effect.
- Music and effects had no way to change at runtime -
  `AudioController` held them in readonly fields - so they are settable
  properties now, and switching music off stops what is already
  playing. `StopMusic` no longer no-ops when music is already off,
  which is what made that possible.
- Both screens are one `SettingsListView` base: the two-column layout,
  the Back row, the navigation and the save-on-change behaviour were
  going to be duplicated otherwise.

### Changed (Engine settings grouped into graphics and sound, 2026-07-29)

- The `engine` element now groups what it holds: `engine.graphics`
  (`fps`, `graphicStyle`, `polygonRenderMode`) and `engine.sound`
  (`musicOn`, `effectsOn`), backed by new `GraphicsConfigSettings` and
  `SoundConfigSettings` types.
- `graphicsBackend` and `tier` stay at the top of `engine`, because
  neither is graphics-only: the backend picks the mixer as well as the
  rasteriser, and the tier picks an asset set that includes the music
  and effects. `graphicsBackend` is renamed to `backend` to stop the
  name claiming otherwise - the `GraphicsBackend` enum becomes
  `Backend`, and both games' `ReadGraphicsBackend` becomes
  `ReadBackend`.
- The shared `engine` block is documented in the main
  [readme](README.md#configuration); each game's readme now documents
  only its own `game` block and links there for the rest.

### Changed (One graphic style for the whole world, 2026-07-29)

- `shipWireframe` and `laserWireframe` are replaced by a single engine
  setting, `graphicStyle` (`Wireframe` or `Solid`). The picture can no
  longer end up half outlines and half filled faces, and it is one
  choice rather than one per object type. `shipRenderMode` moves to the
  engine as `polygonRenderMode`, since it is a property of the
  rasteriser rather than of Elite.
- The per-object styles are now what they always meant: `planetStyle`
  is `Solid | Striped | Fractal` and `sunStyle` is `Solid | Gradient`,
  and both only apply when `graphicStyle` is `Solid`. `PlanetType` loses
  its `Wireframe` member - a wireframe world picks `WireframePlanet` for
  every planet, whatever the style says.
- New `WireframeSun`, since there wasn't one: a plain white filled disc,
  the same size as the filled suns but with none of the flare they
  scatter round the edge. Filled rather than outlined, because an
  outlined circle reads as a planet.
- The Settings screen follows: "Ship Style" and "Laser Style" collapse
  into one "Graphic Style" row, and changing it rebuilds both the planet
  and the sun so the switch shows on the next frame.

### Changed (Config tidy-up: new location, name and shape, 2026-07-29)

- The shared user-data folder is now `The Sharp Kind` rather than
  `TheSharpKind` (`%AppData%\The Sharp Kind` on Windows,
  `~/.config/The Sharp Kind` elsewhere), and the config files are
  `elite.sharp` and `stuntcarracer.sharp` instead of `elitesharp.cfg`
  and `stuntcarracersharp.cfg`. Nothing migrates the old files, so an
  existing install starts from defaults; saves and logs move with the
  folder.
- The config file is now two elements deep: the shared settings live
  under `engine` and each game's own under `game`, so the two can't
  collide as more games arrive. `BaseConfigSettings` is no longer a base
  class - it is `EngineConfigSettings`, a plain type held by the new
  `ConfigSettings<TGameSettings>` root, from which `EliteConfig` and
  `ScrConfig` derive. `GameState.Config` is that root, so the game's own
  settings are reached through `Config.Game.X` and the shared ones
  through `Config.Engine.X`.
- `Fps` moves from `EliteConfigSettings` to the engine settings,
  alongside `GraphicsBackend` and `Tier` - it's a render-loop setting,
  not an Elite one.
- `IsViewFullFrame` is gone. It was get-only with no setter and nothing
  ever assigned it, so it read `false` forever - which made
  `EliteDraw.Bottom`'s `ScreenHeight - BorderWidth` branch dead code,
  while the property itself still turned up in the written file.
- Property names are written in camelCase (`"fps"`, `"instantDock"`),
  matching normal JSON style. Reads are case-insensitive, so a
  hand-edited file in either casing still binds.

### Fixed (3D projection zoom split from the view centre, 2026-07-29)

- Elite's world-to-screen projection was written as
  `((x * 256 / z) + (Centre.X / 2)) * Scale`, which only recovers the
  true view centre when `Scale` is exactly 2. At the 8-bit tier
  (`Scale` 1) everything 3D was centred a quarter of the way across the
  screen instead of the middle — the reason 8-bit ships, planets and
  suns sat up and to the left. It is now `Centre + (x * Focus / z)`,
  where `IEliteDraw.Focus` is the projection's focal length in pixels,
  derived from the tier's screen width (× 1.0). At 16-bit that is
  512 × 1.0, which reduces to the old maths exactly, so the 16-bit
  render is unchanged — verified by screenshot before and after.
- The five sites that inlined the old form are converted:
  `ShipBase.ProjectPoint`, `EliteDraw.ProjectExplosionPoints`,
  `PlanetRenderer.GetPlanetPosition`, `SolidSun.Draw` and
  `GradientSun.Draw`. The planet/sun radii and
  `WireframePlanet`'s detail threshold are in the same 256-wide space,
  so they follow `Focus / 256` rather than `Scale` — which keeps the
  field of view identical at every tier instead of tying it to a
  whole-number magnification.
- `Stars` had it too, which confined the whole 8-bit starfield to the
  top-left quadrant of the viewport. Star coordinates are held in the
  same 256-wide space, so they map to the screen through `Focus / 256`
  as well, and the star-space bounds that recycle a star off the edge
  are now the screen's half-extents divided back through that factor —
  so the starfield fills exactly the view at any tier. The four inlined
  copies of the mapping collapse into one `ToScreen` helper.
- `LaserDraw` carried the same mistaken construction for the crosshair
  centre, the beam target and the two laser mount points; all four now
  come off `Centre` / `ScannerLeft` / `ScannerRight` directly, so the
  8-bit crosshair is centred and the beams converge on it.
- `Scale` is left meaning coordinate/window magnification only, freeing
  it for the `WindowScale` work.

### Added (Elite runs at the 8-bit tier, 2026-07-28)

- `Tier` is a config setting (on `BaseConfigSettings`, so both games
  inherit it), read before the container exists the way `GraphicsBackend`
  already was. Elite's render resolution is derived from it rather than
  being its own setting — 320x256 for 8-bit, 512x512 for 16-bit — so the
  asset set and the resolution cannot disagree. Retires the "Get these
  from config" comment and the dead QHD block.
- `EliteDraw` no longer hardcodes the 16-bit HUD: the scanner's width and
  height come from the scanner bitmap, so each tier's art sets its own
  HUD size (8-bit 320x56 against 16-bit 512x129).
- Bitmap fonts support two sheet shapes. The 16-bit sheets are
  proportional — glyphs run 4 to 17 pixels wide, terminated by magenta
  markers — and the 8-bit BBC Micro sheet is monospaced 8x8 in a
  12-column grid, as the hardware it imitates was. `BitmapFont` carries
  its sheet's geometry instead of a static cell size, and the manifest
  carries it per font.
- A tier's manifest differences live in `AssetManifest.<Tier>.json`
  beside the base manifest, overlaid entry by entry, rather than a
  `TierOverrides` block inside it.
- `Palette/EightBit/palette.json` maps the 29 colour names game code uses
  onto sixteen colours, and the palette now counts against the tier's
  colour cap — colours the game draws with have to be colours the tier
  can show, whether they arrive as pixels or as a name.
- `SoftwareGraphics.DrawImage` clipped nothing: `DrawPixel` only tests
  bounds while a clip region is set, so an image landing partly
  off-screen wrote outside the framebuffer and threw. Bounds are now
  clamped once per image rather than per pixel. 16-bit never hit this
  because nothing there drew off-screen.
- Elite boots, renders and plays at 320x256 with the 8-bit asset set.

### Added (First 8-bit Elite bitmaps, 2026-07-28)

- `Assets/Images/EightBit/` gains `scanner.bmp` and the four laser
  bitmaps. `scanner.bmp` is a 4bpp indexed BMP with a 10-entry palette
  and a 94-byte data offset — a file the old `BitmapReader` would have
  rejected outright on both counts, and the first real asset to exercise
  the broadened decoder.
- The set is 11 distinct opaque colours against the 8-bit cap of 16: the
  lasers reuse the scanner's palette apart from the mining laser's
  purple.
- The tier is **not** declared in the manifest yet. Nine images, a bitmap
  font pair and a palette are still missing, and `AssetLocator`'s
  fallback now points at the empty flat `Images/` folder, so declaring
  `"EightBit"` would produce a tier that cannot load. See the backlog for
  what remains.

### Changed (Posterised the over-budget 16-bit assets, 2026-07-28)

- `font2.bmp` (both games' copies, byte-identical) and SCR's `atlas.bmp`
  are quantised to the 12-bit RGB space real 16-bit hardware used —
  each channel keeps its high nibble and replicates it, so 0xFF stays
  0xFF and 0x00 stays 0x00. `atlas.bmp`'s alpha is snapped to 0 or 255
  at a threshold of 128, clearing all 2765 of its partial-alpha pixels.
  Both were anti-aliased modern-quality art sitting in the 16-bit slot;
  no other asset needed touching.
- Elite's set drops from 2481 distinct opaque colours to 145, SCR's from
  5095 to 349, both against the 4096 cap. Neither game looks different:
  the quantisation is invisible at these palette sizes, confirmed by
  smoke-testing the Elite intro, status screen and front view, and SCR's
  menu, track preview and in-race cockpit.
- With both games compliant, `AssetSet`'s validation is no longer
  warn-only: an over-cap set, or any pixel whose alpha is neither 0 nor
  255, now fails at startup with the per-asset breakdown logged first so
  the message names the files to look at.

### Added (Eager asset loading with colour-budget validation, 2026-07-28)

- `AssetSet` decodes every image and bitmap font for the active tier once
  up front and hands both graphics backends the same `FastBitmap`
  instances. `SoftwareGraphics` decoded via `BitmapReader` while
  `SDLGraphics` decoded via `SDL_LoadBMP`, so the two backends could
  disagree about a file and the SDL one bypassed the managed decoder
  entirely — including any validation attached to it. `SDLGraphics` now
  uploads textures from the decoded bitmaps, setting the blend mode
  explicitly since `SDL_CreateTexture` (unlike
  `SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface`) does not infer it from the alpha
  channel.
- `AssetColourBudget` counts distinct opaque colours across the union of
  a game's whole tier set and checks it against the tier cap (16 for
  8-bit, 4096 for 16-bit). Fully transparent pixels are excluded; pixels
  whose alpha is neither 0 nor 255 are reported separately, since the
  renderer treats transparency as all-or-nothing. Bitmap fonts count too,
  even for the SDL backend that never draws with them — they are part of
  the tier's set.
- Warn-only for now, logged through each app's existing Serilog sinks
  with a per-asset breakdown at Information, until the over-budget assets
  are posterised. Running SCR confirms it end to end: 5095 colours
  against the 4096 cap, `Atlas` 2676 and `Large` 2431, plus 2765
  partial-alpha pixels. Elite's 2481 passes silently.
- `IAssetLocator` gains `Tier` so the validator knows which cap applies.
  `AssetSet` lives in `SharpKind.Graphics` rather than `SharpKind.Assets` — it
  holds `FastBitmap`s, and putting it in `SharpKind.Assets` would invert
  that project reference.

### Added (Per-tier asset resolution, 2026-07-28)

- `SystemTier` (`EightBit`, `SixteenBit`) and tier resolution in
  `AssetLocator`: the tier-varying categories resolve to
  `<Category>/<Tier>/<file>` and fall back to `<Category>/<file>`, which
  is what keeps the tier-neutral categories — audio, models, TrueType
  fonts, tracks — from needing a copy per tier. The tier is fixed at
  construction, so `IAssetLocator`'s members and every consumer of them
  are unchanged.
- `AssetManifest` gains `Tiers`, so asking for a tier a game ships no
  assets for fails at construction rather than silently falling back at
  first draw, and `TierOverrides` for the cases where a tier's set uses a
  different filename for the same logical name.
- Both games' images, bitmap fonts and palette moved into `SixteenBit/`
  subfolders, and both manifests declare that tier. No behaviour change:
  the full suite passes and both games render identically.
- `ScrPalette` and `FakeAssetLocator` each built the palette path by
  hand, bypassing `AssetLocator` entirely — the move broke both.
  `ScrPalette` now goes through `AssetLocator` so tier resolution stays
  in one place; `FakeAssetLocator` still builds a plain string, since its
  consumers include tests with no asset manifest to read. `ScrPalette`
  constructing its own locator remains a composition-root violation and
  is now recorded in the backlog.

### Added (BMP and PNG image decoding, 2026-07-28)

- `ImageReader.Read` is the new single entry point for loading image
  assets, picking the decoder from the file's magic bytes rather than its
  extension. `SoftwareGraphics` now loads images and bitmap fonts through
  it.
- `BitmapReader` was a reader of one specific 32bpp export — it rejected
  every other bit depth and assumed pixel data began at a fixed offset of
  150 bytes. It is now a real BMP decoder: 1/4/8bpp palettised, 24bpp BGR
  and 32bpp BGRA, the header's declared data offset, rows padded to a
  4-byte boundary, and top-down images with a negative height. Compressed
  and BITMAPCOREHEADER files are rejected with a specific message rather
  than decoded wrongly. 32bpp is still read as BGRA rather than honouring
  BI_BITFIELDS masks, which is what every committed asset and
  `BitmapWriter` use.
- `PngReader` decodes non-interlaced PNGs of every colour type and bit
  depth, on `System.IO.Compression.ZLibStream` rather than a third-party
  imaging library, so the Software backend and the headless tests keep
  working. 16-bit samples truncate to their high byte; `tRNS`
  transparency is honoured for palettised, greyscale and truecolour
  images; interlaced files are rejected outright. Chunk CRCs are not
  verified.
- Both decoders are covered by tests building files in memory — bit
  depths, row padding, row order, palette transparency, all five PNG
  scanline filters, and the rejection paths.

### Changed (Glob the asset lists in both game projects, 2026-07-28)

- `EliteSharpLib.csproj` listed all 118 of its assets as individual
  `<None Update>` entries, and `StuntCarRacerSharpLib.csproj` another 32.
  Both are now a single `Assets\**\*` glob, so adding the per-tier asset
  folders from [asset-structure.md](docs/asset-structure.md) needs no
  project-file churn.
- Elite keeps a second, narrower `Assets\SFX\*.wav;Assets\Music\*.ogg`
  entry marking the uncompressed sources `Never` — they stay in source
  control but out of the build output, as before. SCR copies its whole
  asset tree, so it needs no exclusion (its `.wav` files are the ones it
  actually plays).
- One behaviour change: `Assets\SFX\pulse.wav` was the only Elite `.wav`
  marked `PreserveNewest` while its 15 siblings were `Never`. Nothing
  reads it — the manifest maps `Pulse` to `pulse.ogg` — so the glob
  normalises it to `Never` and the file is no longer copied. Asset output
  is otherwise byte-identical for both games.

### Changed (Instant, auto-saved game settings, 2026-07-28)

- Every setting in `SettingsView` now takes effect on the next frame and
  is written to the config file as it's changed, so the "Save Settings"
  row is gone — the last row is now "Back", which just returns to the
  options screen.
- Ship Style previously needed a restart: `IPolygonRenderer` was chosen
  once at DI-registration time. The new `ConfigPolygonRenderer` holds
  the wireframe/painter/z-buffer strategies and picks one per frame from
  the live config.
- Planet Style and Sun Style previously only applied to objects created
  after the change. `Space.RefreshPlanetStyle`/`RefreshSunStyle` rebuild
  the current planet/sun in place, preserving position and orientation.
- `SpaceTests` covers the two refresh methods; new `SettingsViewTests`
  covers the auto-save and the Back row.

### Added (Laser style setting, 2026-07-28)

- The firing laser beams were drawn outlined or filled according to the
  ship-style setting. `EliteConfigSettings.LaserWireframe` now controls
  them independently, exposed as "Laser Style: Solid/Wireframe" in
  `SettingsView` alongside the ship style and persisted with the rest of
  the config.
- `LaserDrawTests` covers the two styles; `sdl-drive`'s key table gained
  the comma/period/slash keys, since the arrow keys are extended-key
  codes that `PostMessage` doesn't deliver to SDL and the settings
  screen's left/right needed a working alternative.

### Added (Per-laser crosshairs and beam colours, 2026-07-28)

- Every laser type drew the same white cross (issue #15). Each type now
  has its own crosshair sprite — `laser-pulse.bmp`, `laser-beam.bmp`,
  `laser-military.bmp`, `laser-mining.bmp` in `Assets/Images`, replacing
  the `laser-crosshairs.png` reference art — drawn centred on the view
  by `LaserDraw.DrawLaserSights`, and the firing beams are coloured per
  type instead of always red-orange: pale yellow for beam and bright
  purple for mining, matching their crosshair sprites, with pulse and
  military staying red-orange.
- `IGraphics.ImageSize` returns a loaded image's width and height, so a
  caller can centre an image on a point rather than only across the
  screen as `DrawImageCentre` does.
- `PilotView` now draws the firing beams alongside the crosshair rather
  than in `Draw()`, which doesn't know which laser is mounted.

### Fixed (Pilot views showed the front laser's crosshair, 2026-07-28)

- `PilotRearView`, `PilotLeftView` and `PilotRightView` all passed
  `_ship.LaserFront.Type` to `DrawLaserSights`, so every view drew the
  front laser's sights; `Combat.FireLaser` already picked the right
  laser per view, so only the visuals were wrong. Each view now passes
  its own laser, which the per-type crosshairs make visible.
- Added `LaserDrawTests` covering the crosshair drawn for each laser
  type and none drawn without a laser.

### Added (Wireframe planet equator, meridian and crater, 2026-07-28)

- `WireframePlanet` drew a bare circle. It now also draws the surface
  detail the original does (`PL9`, `PLS2`/`PLS22` in the BBC Micro
  source): either an equator and a meridian — two half ellipses sharing
  the planet's nose vector, drawn against its roof and side vectors,
  each starting at the `PLS4` angle `arctan(-nosev_z / other_z)` — or a
  crater, a full ellipse of half the planet's radius offset 222/256 of
  the radius along the roof vector and hidden when that vector points
  away. As in the original (`SOS1`), the choice comes from bit 1 of the
  system's tech level, so `PlanetFactory.Create` now takes the tech
  level. No detail is drawn below a radius of 6.
- `WireframePlanet` defaults its pitch and roll to 127 as the original
  sets them, so it turns without damping and the surface detail sweeps
  round. Only this style spins: `SolidPlanet`, `StripedPlanet` and
  `FractalPlanet` map their surface from `Rotmat`'s rows through
  `PlanetRenderer`, which assumes `(M21, M22)` stays unit-length, so a
  turning matrix makes their landscape swim and pulse.
- Added `WireframePlanetTests` cases for the equator-and-meridian, the
  crater, and the crater hidden on the planet's far side.

### Changed (TrueType font sizes moved into the asset manifest, 2026-07-28)

- `SDLGraphics.LoadFont` switched on the game-specific font names
  "Small"/"Large" to pick point sizes 12/18, baking game data into the
  shared library and throwing for any other font name. The point size
  now travels with the asset: `FontsTrueType` manifest entries are
  objects (`{ "File": ..., "PointSize": ... }`), `IAssetLocator`
  exposes `FontTrueTypes` as `TrueTypeFontAsset` (path + point size)
  in place of `FontTrueTypePaths`, and `LoadFont` just opens the file
  at the given size. Both games' manifests keep their existing 12/18
  sizes, so rendering is unchanged.

### Fixed (Universe.RemoveShip left Planet/StationOrSun dangling, 2026-07-28)

- `Universe.RemoveShip` only removed from `_objects`, so passing the
  planet or the station/sun left `Planet`/`StationOrSun` pointing at a
  removed object. Removal now mirrors `AddNewShip`'s routing and clears
  the matching reference. Station removal previously worked only by
  accident, because `Combat.RemoveShip` adds a sun that overwrites
  `StationOrSun` first; that path is unchanged.
- Added `UniverseTests` cases covering planet and station removal.

### Changed (ShipBase draw buffer reuse, 2026-07-28)

- `ShipBase.Draw` allocated a `new Vector4[100]` for every ship on every
  tick; the transformed-point buffer is now a per-instance field grown
  once to the model's point count.
- Deleted the discarded `_ = VectorMaths.UnitVector(...)` call in
  `ShipBase.Draw` — `UnitVector` is pure, so the call had no effect.
- `EliteDraw._pointList`'s magic `100` is now a named `MaxModelPoints`
  constant (it bounds model points, unrelated to the renderers'
  `MAXPOLYS`).

### Fixed (lone-wolf ship models missing from the manifest, 2026-07-27)

- `CobraMk3Lone` and `PythonLone` have no `Models` entry in
  `AssetManifest.json` — they are subclasses of `CobraMk3`/`Python`
  that only change flags, bounty and loot, and share the parent's mesh,
  so there is no model file of their own to list. `ShipFactory` built
  its prototypes straight from the manifest, so neither existed and
  `CreateLoneWolf` threw an unhandled `EliteException` on 2 of its 5
  rolls — `Combat.CreateLoneWolf` has no catch, so a lone-wolf
  encounter could take the game down.
- `ShipFactory.Create` now iterates its own ship table rather than the
  manifest, resolving each ship's model through an `s_modelNames`
  variant→parent map, and skipping ships the manifest supplies no model
  for. Manifest keys that name no known ship still throw.
- Added `ShipFactoryTests.CreateLoneWolfPicksShipByRoll`, which builds
  the factory from the real `AssetLocator` so a missing manifest entry
  for any lone wolf fails the build.

### Changed (ShipFactory: explicit factory table instead of reflection, 2026-07-27)

- `ShipFactory.CreateShipFromName` resolved ship classes from the
  `AssetManifest.json` model names via `Type.GetType` plus a non-public
  `Activator.CreateInstance` (with an `S3011` suppression and two
  TODOs). It now looks the name up in a static
  `Dictionary<string, Func<IEliteDraw, RNG, IShip>>` of explicit
  constructor lambdas covering all 33 ship types, so a bad manifest
  entry is a plain lookup miss rather than arbitrary type activation,
  and the ship constructors stay `internal`.
- Added `ShipFactoryTests.CreateUnknownModelNameThrowsEliteException`
  for the miss path. Full solution builds, full test suite green
  (437 tests), Elite smoke-tested live: intro ship parade and front
  view render as before.

### Changed (streaming texture for the depth-layer composite, 2026-07-27)

- `SDLGraphics.FlushDepthLayer` created an `SDL_Surface` and an
  `SDL_Texture` from the CPU depth layer and destroyed both on every
  flush — a GPU allocation and a synchronous upload for every frame
  drawing depth-tested geometry, which is every frame in SCR and every
  ZBuffer frame in Elite. It now uses one persistent
  `SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING` texture, created alongside the layer in
  `ClearDepth` and re-uploaded with `SDL_UpdateTexture`.
- The new texture sets `SDL_BLENDMODE_BLEND` explicitly:
  `SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface` inferred alpha blending from the
  surface's pixel format, but `SDL_CreateTexture` does not, and the
  depth layer is transparent everywhere nothing was rasterised — left
  at the default it would have painted an opaque rectangle over
  everything drawn before the flush.
- Sibling of the framebuffer-blit change below; same fix, same file
  pair. Full test suite green, both apps smoke-tested live on the
  Hardware backend (Elite's depth-tested intro ship; SCR's track
  preview, where the sky and scenery drawn before the depth pass stay
  visible around the track — the check that blending survived).

### Changed (streaming texture for the software framebuffer blit, 2026-07-27)

- `SoftwareAbstraction.SoftwareScreenUpdate` created an `SDL_Surface`
  and an `SDL_Texture` from the CPU framebuffer on every presented
  frame, then destroyed both — a GPU allocation and a synchronous
  upload per frame. It now creates one
  `SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING` texture in the constructor and
  re-uploads the pixels with `SDL_UpdateTexture`; the texture is
  destroyed in `Dispose` before the renderer.
- The sibling half of the backlog item (`SDLGraphics.DrawImage`/
  `DrawImagePart` creating a texture per call) was already fixed —
  `_imageTextures` is built once in `SDLGraphics.Create`.
- No behaviour change: full test suite green, both apps smoke-tested
  live on the Software backend (Elite's intro, ship parade and front
  view; SCR's track menu and track preview).

### Changed (`Scale` moved out of `IGraphics`, 2026-07-27)

- `IGraphics.Scale` (hardcoded `2` in both backends) was Elite's
  coordinate scale leaking into the shared graphics library — no other
  consumer read it. It is now `IEliteDraw.Scale`, and Elite's ~50 call
  sites go through `_draw.Scale` instead of `_draw.Graphics.Scale`.
- `DrawRectangleCentre` centred with `(ScreenWidth - width) / Scale` in
  both `SoftwareGraphics` and `SDLGraphics`, which was correct only
  because `Scale` happened to equal `2`; it now divides by `2`
  explicitly.
- `SDLGraphics` divided positions by `(2 / Scale)` in ten places — an
  exact no-op at `Scale == 2` — removed.
- `Scale` dropped from `FakeGraphics`, SCR's `RecordingGraphics` (which
  returned `1` and was never read), the `SoftwareGraphics` benchmark and
  the two test assertions covering it. `FakeEliteDraw` gained it.
- No behaviour change: full test suite green, both apps smoke-tested
  live (Elite's intro, charts and front view; SCR's track menu, preview
  and race HUD).

### Closed (issue #5, "Measure/improve code complexity", 2026-07-27)

- The whole solution was audited with each candidate rule raised to
  `warning` under `TreatWarningsAsErrors=false`, counts deduplicated by
  file/line (multi-targeting reports each site twice):

  | Rule | Violations | Outcome |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `CA1502` cyclomatic complexity | — | Enabled at `warning` |
  | `CA1506` class coupling | — | Enabled at `warning` |
  | `S1451` license headers | 333 → 0 | Fixed and enabled |
  | `S2234` argument order | 4 → 0 | Fixed and enabled |
  | `S2583` unreachable code | 0 | Enabled |
  | `S1541` method complexity | 61 (all prod) | Left `none` |
  | `S3776` cognitive complexity | 41 (40 prod) | Split methods, then enabled |
  | `S107` parameter count | 20 (19 prod) | Left `none` |
  | `S109` magic numbers | 4087 (4085 prod) | Left `none` |

- The rules left at `severity = none` are recorded under Won't in the
  [backlog](docs/backlog-roadmap.md): their remaining sites are
  concentrated in ported 6502/Amiga reference methods whose length and
  hardcoded constants are inherent to the source algorithms, and
  `CA1502`/`CA1506` already enforce a complexity ceiling.

### Added (`CA5394` enabled, 2026-07-27)

- Enabled `CA5394` (do not use insecure randomness), scoped off in the
  two assemblies that must reach `System.Random` directly rather than
  repo-wide:
  - `SharpKind` (its own `.editorconfig`) — `RandomSource` is the single
    wrapper every game and test goes through, deliberately the fast,
    seedable kind of randomness rather than a cryptographic one.
  - `StuntCarRacerSharpLib.Tests` (its own `.editorconfig`) —
    `OpponentPhysicsTests` drives a seeded `Random` directly to assert
    the opponent's speed logic consumes the RNG stream exactly once per
    piece; comparing the raw stream *is* the assertion, so it cannot go
    through `IRandomSource`.
- The rule's stale "Disabled repo-wide" comment in the root
  [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) was corrected to match.

### Added (`CA1515` enabled, 2026-07-27)

- Enabled `CA1515` (consider making public types internal). Seven types
  could not be narrowed, each scoped off where it lives rather than
  repo-wide:
  - The BenchmarkDotNet classes in `src/elite/perf` and
    `src/useful/perf` (a new `.editorconfig` per `perf` folder) —
    BenchmarkDotNet compiles a generated runner into a separate assembly
    that references them, so they must stay public.
  - `RecordingGraphics` and `FakeAbstraction` in
    `StuntCarRacerSharpLib.Fakes` (its own `.editorconfig`) — a shared
    fakes library consumed by `StuntCarRacerSharpLib.Tests`. `CA1515`
    fires there only because `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` generates an entry
    point, which makes the assembly look like an application; the Elite
    and SharpKind fakes projects do not reference it and stayed silent.
  - `SoftwareSoundTests.AudioAssetFixture`, folded into the `CA1034`
    `#pragma` already covering it — xUnit1000 requires a public test
    class and CS0051 then forces the fixture public too.

### Added (`S1451` license headers enforced, 2026-07-27)

- Enabled `S1451` (missing copyright/license header). Sonar rule
  parameters cannot be set from `.editorconfig` — only from a
  `SonarLint.xml` supplied as an `AdditionalFiles` item — so
  [SonarLint.xml](SonarLint.xml) is new at the repo root and wired into
  every project from [Directory.Build.props](Directory.Build.props). It
  matches the header by shape rather than by three literal strings
  (`// '[^']+' - Andy Hawkins \d{4}(-\d{4})?\.`), so it stays valid as
  years advance and covers all three header variants.
- Copyright years brought up to date in the `file_header_template`
  values and across all files: Elite `2023` → `2023-2026`, SharpKind
  `2025` → `2023-2026`. SCR keeps `2026`, and gained the
  `src/scr/.editorconfig` `file_header_template` it never had — until
  now `IDE0073` was not checking SCR's headers at all.
- Upstream attribution lines (C.J. Pinder / Bell & Braben for Elite,
  the remake and Crammond/MicroStyle/MicroProse lines for SCR) are
  unchanged; the multi-line templates still carry them.

### Added (Analyser audit; `S2234`/`S2583` enabled, 2026-07-27)

- Completed the code-quality-gate audit from issue #5: built the whole
  solution with `S107`, `S109`, `S1451`, `S1541`, `S2234`, `S2583` and
  `S3776` each at `warning` and `TreatWarningsAsErrors=false`, and
  recorded deduplicated per-rule counts in
  [backlog-roadmap.md](docs/backlog-roadmap.md) (multi-targeting reports
  every site twice, so raw warning totals are double the real figure).
  Headline: `S109` 4087, `S1451` 333, `S1541` 61, `S3776` 41, `S107` 20,
  `S2234` 4, `S2583` 0.
- Enabled the two correctness-flavoured rules outright, joining `CA1502`
  and `CA1506`: `S2583` (unreachable conditional code) was already clean,
  and `S2234`'s four sites were all false positives from deliberate
  coordinate swaps, cleared by renaming the parameters rather than
  suppressing — `PlanetRenderer.RenderPlanetLine`'s `x`/`y` become
  `offsetX`/`offsetY` (its four callers mirror the octants of Doros'
  circle algorithm on purpose), and `TrackRendererTests.Cross`'s
  `a`/`b`/`c` become `origin`/`first`/`second`. No behaviour change; the
  visual-dump tests cover the planet renderer.
- The remaining rules stay `none` with follow-up backlog items:
  complexity/parameter-count wants a tracked, ratcheted report rather
  than a hard gate, `S1451` is a mechanical 333-file decision, and
  `S109` is recommended against enabling at all.

### Fixed (Planets painting over the view border, 2026-07-27)

- The previous entry below claimed `WireframePlanet`/`FractalPlanet`/
  `PlanetRenderer` had "no reference to the view bounds at all" — that
  was wrong; `GetPlanetPosition`'s bounding-box cull and
  `RenderPlanetLine`'s per-pixel clip against `IEliteDraw.Left`/`Right`/
  `Top`/`Bottom` have existed since 2025-03-19 (`git blame`), well before
  issue #8. Live-testing found no bleed into the scanner console, but the
  user pointed at the actual bug: the planet's fill paints directly over
  the 1px-wide border line itself. Root cause: `EliteDraw.DrawBorder`
  ([EliteDraw.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Graphics/EliteDraw.cs))
  draws its rectangle via `Graphics.DrawRectangle`, whose last-inclusive-
  pixel convention (`start + size - 1`) puts the border's own row/column
  one pixel inside of what `Right`/`Bottom` claim, while `Left`/`Top`
  (position-based, no such convention) already line up correctly with
  the border's near edge. Pixel-sampled a screenshot to confirm: the
  border's right column and bottom row both sit at `Right - 1`/
  `Bottom - 1`, one pixel short of where every consumer assumed. Fixed
  both places that derive a content boundary from `Right`/`Bottom`:
  `PlanetRenderer.RenderPlanetLine`'s manual clip (`s.Y >= Bottom`/
  `s.X < Right`, mirroring the already-correct `Top`/`Left` exclusions)
  covers `FractalPlanet`/`StripedPlanet`, and `EliteDraw.Width`/`Height`
  (feeding `SetViewClipRegion`'s graphics-level clip, `-1` each) covers
  `WireframePlanet`/`SolidPlanet`, which draw via `DrawCircle`/
  `DrawCircleFilled` with no manual bounds check of their own — and this
  same clip region is shared by ships and lasers, so it closes the same
  1px gap there too. `Right`/`Bottom`/`Bottom`-as-height stayed
  unchanged, since `DrawBorder` still needs them to draw the border in
  its current (correct) visual position; only the content-boundary
  consumers were tightened. Verified by pixel-sampling a live screenshot
  before and after: the border row was the planet's fill colour
  (`16,80,144`) before the fix and pure white (`255,255,255`, matching
  an unobstructed reference column) after. Full solution build and full
  test suite (436 tests) pass. Removed the backlog item this was split
  from, since its stated cause didn't hold up.

### Fixed (Enemy laser fire follows the ship's real firing direction, 2026-07-27)

- `ShipBase.DrawLasers` ([ShipBase.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Ships/ShipBase.cs))
  drew each NPC's laser bolt from its mount point to `(Location.X > 0 ? 0
  : 511, _rng.Random(256) * 2)` — a screen-edge X picked by which side the
  ship was on, paired with a Y uniformly random over the whole view,
  ignoring the ship's actual firing angle, and hardcoded to a 512-tall
  view regardless of `ScannerWidth`/height. Replaced with a real
  direction-to-boundary projection: extend the ship's local vector from
  its origin through the laser mount out to a very large distance
  (`FarAimDistance`), project it through the same perspective transform as
  every other model point (factored into a new shared `ProjectPoint`
  helper) to get the on-screen vanishing point of the ship's real firing
  direction, add a small random spread (`LaserAimSpread`) so repeated
  shots still vary, then clip the ray to wherever it actually leaves the
  view rectangle (`IEliteDraw.Left`/`Right`/`Top`/`Bottom`, derived from
  screen size) via a new `ProjectToViewBoundary` helper. Investigated the
  reporter's second concern (planets not clipped to the scanner/viewport
  boundary either) — confirmed `WireframePlanet`/`FractalPlanet`/
  `PlanetRenderer` still have no reference to the view bounds, but that's
  a separate, unfixed concern (different draw path, not covered by this
  change) and remains open. Added
  `ShipBaseTests.DrawLasersProjectsAlongFiringDirectionAndClipsToViewBoundary`,
  which replicates the projection/clip math independently and asserts the
  drawn endpoint lands where the real trajectory exits the view rather
  than at a fixed screen edge. Verified with a full solution build, the
  full test suite (436 passing), and by launching `EliteSharp` through
  several undocked flight/combat sessions (firing the player's own laser,
  which shares the same `DrawPolygonFilled` draw path) with no crashes or
  rendering regressions; was unable to reproduce a live NPC-fired shot in
  the time available (ship encounters are probabilistic) to visually
  confirm this specific path beyond the unit test.

### Changed (Extract shared star-plot helper in Stars, 2026-07-24)

- `Stars.FrontStarfield`/`RearStarfield`/`SideStarfield`
  ([Stars.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Stars.cs)) each repeated the
  same ~30-line block that plots a star at its current screen location
  (bounds-check, draw the 1-4 pixels sized by depth) before moving it;
  extracted into a private `PlotStar(int i)` helper returning the
  computed screen position, cutting ~60 duplicated lines. Behaviour is
  unchanged — same computation, same draw calls, same order. Verified
  with a full solution build, the full test suite, and by launching
  `EliteSharp` (ran cleanly through several seconds of frames, which
  exercise all three starfield draw paths, before being stopped).

### Removed (Delete stale build-output-only directories, 2026-07-24)

- Deleted `src/elite/apps/EliteSharp.SDL/`, `src/elite/libs/EliteSharp/`,
  `src/elite/test/EliteSharp.Tests/`, and
  `src/elite/perf/EliteSharp.Benchmarks/` — leftovers from earlier project
  renames, each containing only `bin`/`obj` output, already gitignored
  (never tracked), and referenced by no project or solution entry.

### Changed (Clean stale EliteSharpLib.csproj items, 2026-07-24)

- `EliteSharpLib.csproj` carried a `<Compile Remove="Controls\**" />` /
  `<EmbeddedResource Remove="Controls\**" />` / `<None Remove="Controls\**" />`
  block and fourteen `None Update="sfx\*.wav"` items pointing at a
  `Controls/` and a `sfx/` folder that no longer exist under
  `src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/`; removed both (confirmed neither path
  exists). Left the ~280-line hand-maintained `Assets\*` item list as-is —
  converting it to glob items is a separate, purely stylistic change with
  its own risk of altering per-extension `CopyToOutputDirectory` overrides
  (e.g. `.wav`/`.ogg` pairs under `Assets\SFX`/`Assets\Music` set
  `Never`/`PreserveNewest` differently), not needed to fix the stale
  references.

### Changed (Remove Vector4.Cloner(), 2026-07-24)

- `Vector4.Cloner()`
  ([MathsExtensions.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind/Maths/MathsExtensions.cs))
  new'd up a copy of a `Vector4`, but `Vector4` is a struct, so plain
  assignment already copies; replaced its four call sites in
  [Extensions.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Extensions.cs) and
  [Space.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Space.cs) with direct
  assignment and deleted the method. Dropped the now-unused
  `using SharpKind.Maths;` from `Extensions.cs`.

### Fixed (Remove debug log spam from DrawCircleFilled, 2026-07-24)

- `SoftwareGraphics.DrawCircleFilled`
  ([SoftwareGraphics.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.Graphics/SoftwareGraphics.cs))
  left a `Debug.WriteLine($"{x},{y}")` in its scanline loop, logging every
  scanline of every filled circle (planets, suns) every debug-build frame;
  removed.

### Removed (Close stale SDLSound loop-pitch threading item, 2026-07-24)

- The backlog's "document and harden the `SDLSound` loop-pitch threading
  contract" item described the old SDL2_mixer `Mix_RegisterEffect`
  resampler, where a managed callback running on the audio thread read a
  pitch field the game thread wrote. The 2026-07-23 SDL2→SDL3 migration
  (see below) replaced that whole mechanism: `SDLSound.PlayLoop`
  ([SDLSound.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.SDL/SDLSound.cs)) now calls
  `MIX_SetTrackFrequencyRatio` directly, a native SDL3_mixer API with no
  managed callback and no field shared across threads — confirmed no
  `Mix_RegisterEffect` usage remains anywhere in `src/`. Nothing left to
  document or harden, so the item is closed rather than actioned.

### Changed (Message the bare ShipFactory exceptions, 2026-07-24)

- The `throw new EliteException()` calls in `ShipFactory`'s `CreateLoneWolf`,
  `CreatePackHunter`, `CreatePirate`, and `CreateTrader` switch-expression
  defaults ([ShipFactory.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Ships/ShipFactory.cs))
  carried no message, so a hit would be undiagnosable in a log; each now
  reports the offending roll (and, for the lone-wolf case, the computed
  index alongside the underlying `rnd`).

### Added (Track benchmark history in CI, 2026-07-24)

- Resolved the "how to record and monitor historical benchmark numbers"
  decision from the previous cleanup: added
  [.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml](.github/workflows/benchmarks.yml), a
  `workflow_dispatch`-only job (manual trigger — shared runners are too
  noisy to gate every push/PR on) that runs all three `*.Benchmarks`
  projects and records each benchmark class's results to the `gh-pages`
  branch via `benchmark-action/github-action-benchmark`, giving each class
  its own trend chart. Added `[JsonExporterAttribute.FullCompressed]` to
  `PlanetBenchmarks`, `SunBenchmarks`, `KeyboardBenchmarks`, and
  `SoftwareGraphicsBenchmarks` so BenchmarkDotNet emits the JSON report the
  action reads. Also fixed `EliteSharpLib.Benchmarks/Program.cs`, which ran
  `PlanetBenchmarks` twice instead of running `SunBenchmarks` too — found
  while wiring this up; `SunBenchmarks` had never actually executed.
  One-time manual step still needed once this merges: enable GitHub Pages
  (Settings → Pages → Source → `gh-pages` branch) after the workflow's
  first run creates the branch, to get a browsable dashboard. Built the
  full solution (all green); did not execute the new workflow itself,
  since it depends on the `gh-pages` branch/Pages state.

### Changed (Fix EliteSharp namespace rename leftover and stop committing benchmark reports, 2026-07-24)

- `LogMessages.cs` was still in namespace `EliteSharp.SDL` from before the
  `EliteSharp.SDL` project was renamed to `EliteSharp` (`SDLProgram.cs` had
  already been fixed); moved it to `EliteSharp` and dropped the now-unused
  `using EliteSharp.SDL;` from `SDLProgram.cs`.
- Removed the committed BenchmarkDotNet report files under
  `src/elite/perf/EliteSharpLib.Benchmarks/reports/`,
  `src/useful/perf/SharpKind.Input.Benchmarks/reports/`, and
  `src/useful/perf/SharpKind.Graphics.Benchmarks/reports/` — generated
  artifacts per the architecture doc's solution-hygiene rule — and added
  `src/*/perf/*/reports/` to `.gitignore` so they don't get recommitted.
  How to record and monitor historical benchmark numbers over time (e.g. a
  CI job that posts results to a PR comment) remains an open decision, not
  addressed here. Built the full solution and ran the complete test suite
  (all green).

### Changed (Pin FastBitmap pixel arrays lazily, 2026-07-24)

- `FastBitmap` pinned its pixel array with a `GCHandle` in the constructor
  unconditionally, even though `BitmapHandle` (the only reader of the pin) is
  never touched by short-lived bitmaps such as the LRU text-glyph cache
  ([SoftwareGraphics.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.Graphics/SoftwareGraphics.cs))
  or the intermediates `FastBitmap.Resize` creates — only the screen
  framebuffer and SDL's depth-layer bitmap ever cross into native code.
  `BitmapHandle` now allocates the pinned `GCHandle` on first access instead
  of in the constructor, and `Dispose` only frees it if it was ever pinned,
  so bitmaps that never leave managed code no longer permanently pin (and
  fragment the GC heap with) their backing array. Built the full solution
  and ran the complete test suite (all green).

### Changed (ScreenManager.Current no longer nullable, 2026-07-24)

- `ScreenManager<TId, TScreen>.Current` was `TScreen?`, forcing every
  post-setup call site (`EliteMain.Update`, `StuntCarRacerMain.Update`/`Draw`,
  `GameState.CurrentView`) to use the null-forgiving operator. `Current` is
  now `TScreen` and throws `InvalidOperationException` if read before `Set`
  has been called at least once — both games already call `Set` during
  construction/init, before their update loops run, so this only changes an
  unreachable silent-null path into a diagnosable exception.
  `ScreenManager.CurrentId` is unchanged (`default!` on an unset enum ID is
  harmless — it's only ever compared, never dereferenced).

### Added (Test coverage badge on README, 2026-07-24)

- The CI coverage step turned out to be silently broken: `Directory.Build.props`
  sets `DebugType=none`/`DebugSymbols=false` for Release builds, so the
  `dotnet-coverage collect` + `coverage.runsettings` pipeline had no PDBs to
  map hits to source lines and had been uploading an empty/all-zero
  `coverage.cobertura.xml` artifact (its module-include filter also never
  covered `StuntCarRacerSharpLib`). Replaced it in
  [build-and-package.yml](.github/workflows/build-and-package.yml) with
  `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` (coverlet, already referenced
  by every test project) run with `-p:DebugType=portable -p:DebugSymbols=true`
  for that build+test pass only, merged across all test projects and rendered
  to an SVG with ReportGenerator (`-assemblyfilters` drops `*.Tests`/`*.Fakes`/
  `*.Benchmarks` so the number reflects shipped code, both games included).
  The CI job now commits the refreshed badge to
  [docs/images/coverage-badge.svg](docs/images/coverage-badge.svg) on pushes
  to `master` (`[skip ci]`, needs `permissions: contents: write`), and
  README.md displays it. Removed the now-unused `coverage.runsettings`.
  Real numbers as of this change: 70.8% line coverage.

### Changed (Adopt central package management, 2026-07-24)

- All 26 `.csproj` files pinned `PackageReference` versions independently.
  Added `Directory.Packages.props` at the repo root with
  `ManagePackageVersionsCentrally` and one `PackageVersion` per package
  (29 total), and dropped the `Version` attribute from every
  `PackageReference` in the tree. The five analyzer packages
  (`Roslynator.Analyzers`, `Roslynator.CodeAnalysis.Analyzers`,
  `Roslynator.Formatting.Analyzers`, `SonarAnalyzer.CSharp`,
  `StyleCop.Analyzers`) were copy-pasted with identical
  `PrivateAssets`/`IncludeAssets` settings into every project, so those
  moved into [Directory.Build.props](Directory.Build.props) instead,
  alongside the existing `MinVer` reference (now also version-less).
  No package versions changed. Verified with a full solution build, the
  full test suite, and a smoke launch of both `EliteSharp` and
  `StuntCarRacerSharp`.

### Fixed (FractalPlanet landscape generation wasn't deterministic per system, 2026-07-24)

- `FractalPlanet.GenerateLandscape`
  ([FractalPlanet.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Planets/FractalPlanet.cs))
  seeded a local `Random(seed)` for the corner grid but drew
  `CalcMidpointColor`'s midpoint-displacement jitter from the shared
  game-wide `RNG`, so a planet's fine detail differed between visits to
  the same system depending on how much other game activity had advanced
  the shared RNG in between — unlike the reference
  `generate_fractal_landscape(rnd_seed)` (`fesh0r/newkind`'s `threed.c`),
  which reseeds one stream for the whole landscape so revisiting a system
  always renders a byte-identical planet. Both the corner grid and the
  jitter now draw from the one seeded `RandomSource` local to each
  `FractalPlanet`, which also made the `RNG` dependency unused — dropped
  it from `FractalPlanet`'s constructor, `PlanetFactory.Create`, and the
  two call sites in `Space.cs`. Added
  `FractalPlanetTests.GenerateLandscapeIsDeterministicPerSeed`, which
  failed under the old shared-RNG behaviour and passes now.

### Changed (Remove analyzer suppressions in favour of real fixes or scoped disables, 2026-07-24)

- Worked through the backlog's suppression list: CA2227 collection
  properties ([ThreeDModel.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.Assets/Models/ThreeDModel.cs),
  `Point.cs`, `Face.cs`, `AssetManifest.cs`,
  [SaveState.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Save/SaveState.cs)) became
  init-only, since `System.Text.Json` supports that natively. CA1308
  ([Extensions.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Extensions.cs)) and
  RCS1231 were resolved with equivalent code the rules don't flag.
  SA1401's exposed field
  ([PlanetRenderer.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Planets/PlanetRenderer.cs))
  became a property. CA5394
  ([RandomSource.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind/RandomSource.cs),
  `FractalPlanet.cs`) and S6640 (assembly-scoped in `SharpKind.SDL`, unsafe
  interop only) are verified false positives for this codebase, so
  they're now disabled via `.editorconfig` instead of scattered local
  suppressions — a more honest opt-out. CA1034
  (`SoftwareSoundTests.cs`) is confirmed unfixable (xUnit1000 requires a
  public test class, which then forces its constructor parameter type
  public too via CS0051) and stays as a justified local suppression.
  Documented the resulting triage policy in
  [architecture-principles.md](docs/architecture-principles.md). One suppression remains,
  `ShipFactory.cs` (S3011, reflection into a non-public constructor) —
  left for the `ShipFactory.CreateShipFromName` dictionary-replacement
  item, which resolves it as a side effect.

### Changed (Replace custom Guard.ArgumentNull with ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull, 2026-07-24)

- `Guard.ArgumentNull` ([Guard.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind/Guard.cs)) was a
  hand-rolled null-check helper predating .NET's
  `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull`, which does the same job as a framework
  intrinsic (per the architecture doc's "prefer dotnet framework intrinsics"
  rule). Replaced all call sites across `SharpKind.*`, `EliteSharpLib`, and
  `StuntCarRacerSharpLib` with `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull`, then
  deleted `Guard.cs`, `ValidatedNotNullAttribute.cs`, and `GuardTests.cs`.
  Dropped the now-unused `using SharpKind;` this left behind in nine files.

### Fixed (Config file never written to %AppData% until a setting was changed, 2026-07-24)

- `ConfigFile<T>.ReadConfig()`
  ([ConfigFile.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind/Config/ConfigFile.cs)) only ever
  read from disk, falling back to `new T()` in memory when no file existed;
  it never wrote that file back out. Both games only call `WriteConfig`
  from their Settings/Options screen, so on a fresh install
  `%AppData%\TheSharpKind` stayed empty until the user opened Settings —
  nothing else confirmed the config path was writable or let a player find
  the file to hand-edit. `ReadConfig` now checks whether the file existed
  before reading, and if not, writes the resolved defaults immediately so a
  config file always appears at startup for both Elite
  (`elitesharp.cfg`) and SCR (`stuntcarracersharp.cfg`). Corrupt/invalid
  existing files are untouched, since the write only happens when the file
  was missing beforehand. Verified via the existing `ConfigFileTests` in
  both `SharpKind.Tests` and `EliteSharpLib.Tests`.

### Changed (Extract a shared BaseConfigSettings to deduplicate the two games' config types, 2026-07-23)

- `ConfigSettings` (Elite) and `ScrConfigSettings` (SCR) had drifted into
  duplicating the same three properties — `EffectsOn`, `GraphicsBackend`,
  `MusicOn` — with identical defaults and comments. Added
  `BaseConfigSettings`
  ([BaseConfigSettings.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.Abstraction/Config/BaseConfigSettings.cs))
  to `SharpKind.Abstraction.Config` — the only assembly already referenced by
  both game libraries that can also see the `GraphicsBackend` enum — and had
  both settings types inherit from it instead. `ScrConfigSettings` had
  nothing game-specific left, so it collapsed to
  `internal sealed class ScrConfigSettings : BaseConfigSettings;`
  ([ScrConfigSettings.cs](src/scr/libs/StuntCarRacerSharpLib/Config/ScrConfigSettings.cs)).
  Also renamed Elite's settings type from `ConfigSettings` to
  `EliteConfigSettings`
  ([EliteConfigSettings.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Config/EliteConfigSettings.cs))
  to match the SCR naming and avoid confusion with the generic
  `SharpKind.Config.ConfigFile<T>` machinery it's used with. `ConfigFile<T>`
  itself needed no changes — it was already generic. Verified both games'
  libs, both test projects, and the config round-trip tests still pass.

### Fixed (SCR crash on Hardware GraphicsBackend: missing FontsTrueType manifest entry, 2026-07-23)

- Selecting `GraphicsBackend: Hardware` for StuntCarRacerSharp crashed at
  startup with `KeyNotFoundException: The given key 'Small' was not present
  in the dictionary` from `SDLGraphics.DrawTextLeft`
  ([SDLGraphics.cs:375](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.SDL/SDLGraphics.cs)), reached
  via `TrackMenuScreen.Draw()`. `SDLGraphics` loads its `_fonts` dictionary
  from `IAssetLocator.FontTrueTypePaths`, which is populated from the
  manifest's `FontsTrueType` section — but SCR's
  [AssetManifest.json](src/scr/libs/StuntCarRacerSharpLib/Assets/AssetManifest.json)
  only ever had a `FontsBitmap` section (used by the `Software` backend), so
  under `Hardware` the font dictionary came back empty. Elite's manifest
  already had both sections. Added a `FontsTrueType` section to SCR's
  manifest (`Small`/`Large` both mapping to `OpenSans-Regular.ttf`, matching
  Elite's mapping), copied that font file into
  `src/scr/libs/StuntCarRacerSharpLib/Assets/FontsTrueType/`, and added the
  matching `CopyToOutputDirectory` entry in
  [StuntCarRacerSharpLib.csproj](src/scr/libs/StuntCarRacerSharpLib/StuntCarRacerSharpLib.csproj).
  Verified with a full solution build and confirmed the TTF now lands in the
  app's `bin/Assets/FontsTrueType` output.

### Added (GraphicsBackend config switch between Software and SDL3_mixer-backed Hardware audio, 2026-07-23)

- The in-progress SDL2→SDL3 migration had staged `SDLAbstraction.cs`/`SDLSound.cs`
  ([SDLAbstraction.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.SDL/SDLAbstraction.cs),
  [SDLSound.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.SDL/SDLSound.cs)) for deletion: `SDLSound`
  was built entirely on the old `SDL2.SDL_mixer` API, which no longer compiles
  now that `SharpKind.SDL` has moved to `ppy.SDL3-CS`/`ppy.SDL3_mixer-CS`, and
  `SDLAbstraction` only failed to compile because of that. Both games were left
  hardcoded to `SoftwareAbstraction`, with no way to opt into hardware-accelerated
  rendering at all. Restored `SDLAbstraction` unchanged and rewrote `SDLSound`
  against SDL3_mixer's new `MIX_Track` API — an improvement over the old one, not
  just a port: SDL3_mixer exposes per-track pitch (`MIX_SetTrackFrequencyRatio`)
  and panning (`MIX_SetTrackStereo`) natively, so the old resample-via-effect-callback
  trick (and its single dedicated "pitched one-shot" channel) is gone; all 16
  voices in the one-shot pool can now carry their own pitch, matching
  `SoftwareSound`'s capabilities instead of a subset of them.

  Added a `GraphicsBackend` enum (`SharpKind.Abstraction`,
  [GraphicsBackend.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.Abstraction/GraphicsBackend.cs):
  `Software` or `Hardware`) and a matching `GraphicsBackend` property (default
  `Software`) on both games' settings —
  [EliteConfigSettings.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Config/EliteConfigSettings.cs) and
  [ScrConfigSettings.cs](src/scr/libs/StuntCarRacerSharpLib/Config/ScrConfigSettings.cs).
  Since those settings types are internal (so `Program.Main` can't reference them
  directly — the same reason `AddEliteConfig`/`AddScrConfig` exist) and
  `SharpKind.SDL` is deliberately not a dependency of either game-logic library,
  each library instead exposes a `ReadGraphicsBackend(userDataPath, loggerFactory)`
  helper
  ([EliteServiceCollectionExtensions.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/EliteServiceCollectionExtensions.cs),
  [StuntCarRacerServiceCollectionExtensions.cs](src/scr/libs/StuntCarRacerSharpLib/StuntCarRacerServiceCollectionExtensions.cs))
  that reads just the public enum. Both `SDLProgram.cs`s
  ([Elite](src/elite/apps/EliteSharp/SDLProgram.cs),
  [SCR](src/scr/apps/StuntCarRacerSharp/SDLProgram.cs)) now read that setting
  before building the DI container and construct `SDLAbstraction` or
  `SoftwareAbstraction` accordingly, instead of hardcoding `SoftwareAbstraction`.

  Live-testing the `Hardware` backend against a real `elitesharp.cfg` surfaced a
  second issue: SDL3_mixer's bundled MIDI decoder is Timidity-derived and expects
  a GUS patch set on disk via `timidity.cfg`, which this project doesn't ship, so
  loading `theme.mid`/`danube.mid` failed with "Audio data is in
  unknown/unsupported/corrupt format" and crashed the app at DI-composition time.
  `SDLSound` now predecodes `.mid` music with the same MeltySynth + bundled
  `TimGM6mb.sf2` SoundFont path `SoftwareSound` already uses successfully, and
  hands the result to the mixer as raw PCM via `MIX_LoadRawAudio`; `.ogg` SFX
  still load through SDL3_mixer's native decoder unchanged. Docs
  (`elite-readme.md`, `scr-readme.md`) Configuration sections updated with the
  new setting. Built the full solution (`SharpKind.SDL` and both apps/libs/test
  projects) and ran `EliteSharp` against the real `%AppData%\TheSharpKind\elitesharp.cfg`
  (`GraphicsBackend: Hardware`) that had previously crashed it, confirming it now
  starts cleanly.

### Changed (Renamed StuntCarRacer to StuntCarRacerSharp; SCR added to CI, 2026-07-22)

- `build-and-package.yml` only built/published EliteSharp, so master/PR
  builds never caught SCR publish regressions. Added matching
  `StuntCarRacerSharp` Windows/Linux publish + artifact-upload steps and
  renamed the workflow from "Build and Package EliteSharp" to "Build and
  Package" since it now covers both games.
- SCR's app/library/test project names (`StuntCarRacer`,
  `StuntCarRacerLib`, `StuntCarRacerLib.Tests`, `StuntCarRacerLib.Fakes`)
  didn't end in "Sharp" the way Elite's do (`EliteSharp`,
  `EliteSharpLib`, ...), an inconsistency across the two games in this
  shared repo. Renamed throughout: project/folder/csproj names to
  `StuntCarRacerSharp`/`StuntCarRacerSharpLib`/`StuntCarRacerSharpLib.Tests`/
  `StuntCarRacerSharpLib.Fakes`, their C# `namespace`s and `using`s, the
  `.slnx` entries, `.gitignore`'s asset-tracking rule, `README.md`'s
  `dotnet run` path, and every reference across `docs/backlog-roadmap.md`
  and this file. Left the internal class names as-is (`StuntCarRacerMain`,
  `StuntCarRacerServiceCollectionExtensions`, ...), matching how Elite
  keeps `EliteMain`/`EliteServiceCollectionExtensions` unprefixed inside
  `EliteSharpLib` — only the project/assembly identifier gains the
  suffix. Also left ptitSeb's reference-source mentions
  (`StuntCarRacer.cpp`) untouched since that's an external C++ file, not
  our code. Built the full solution, ran the complete test suite (all
  green: 84 EliteSharpLib.Tests + 188 StuntCarRacerSharpLib.Tests), and
  smoke-tested both `EliteSharp` and `StuntCarRacerSharp` via the
  `GAME_KEY_SCRIPT`/`GAME_FRAME_DUMP_DIR` harness, confirming both still
  launch and render their opening screens correctly under the renamed
  assemblies.

### Added (Tag-triggered release CI, 2026-07-22)

- No CI path published Release artifacts or cut a GitHub Release; tagging
  `v1.0.0` would have done nothing. Added
  [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml), triggered on `v*` tags,
  which self-contained-publishes both EliteSharp and StuntCarRacerSharp for
  win-x64/linux-x64/linux-arm64, zips each app/RID combination, and creates
  a GitHub Release via `softprops/action-gh-release` with
  `generate_release_notes: true` and a body noting the StuntCarRacerSharp builds
  are preview given its open defects list. StuntCarRacerSharp had no publish
  profiles at all, so added `PublishProfileWindows`/`PublishProfileLinux`/
  `PublishProfileLinuxArm64` under
  [StuntCarRacerSharp/Properties/PublishProfiles](src/scr/apps/StuntCarRacerSharp/Properties/PublishProfiles)
  mirroring Elite's, plus the missing `PublishProfileLinuxArm64` for Elite.
  Both apps' existing profiles published into the same repo-root
  `publish/<rid>/` folder, which would have let StuntCarRacerSharp's publish
  overwrite EliteSharp's (or vice versa) once both ran in one job — renamed
  every `PublishDir` to `publish/<AppName>/<rid>/` and updated
  [build-and-package.yml](.github/workflows/build-and-package.yml)'s
  artifact-upload paths to match. Built the full solution, ran the
  complete test suite (all green), and locally ran all six
  app/RID `dotnet publish` combinations to confirm each lands in its own
  directory with no errors.

### Changed (Tag-driven semantic versioning via MinVer, 2026-07-22)

- CI stamped `Version`/`FileVersion` from `0.<yy><day-of-year>.<run-number>.0`,
  so version numbers reset meaning every build and carried no relation to
  releases. Added `MinVer` (via [Directory.Build.props](Directory.Build.props),
  `MinVerTagPrefix` `v`, matching the already-decided `v1.0.0` first-tag
  scheme) so every project's version is now derived from the nearest `v*`
  git tag plus commit height — tagging a commit *is* the release-versioning
  step, with untagged builds getting a `0.0.0-alpha.0.<height>+<sha>`
  pre-release version. Updated
  [build-and-package.yml](.github/workflows/build-and-package.yml) to fetch
  full history (MinVer needs the tags), removed the manual
  `/p:Version=.../p:FileVersion=...` stamping from every build/test/publish
  step, and now reads the computed version for artifact naming via the
  `minver-cli` global tool instead. Built the full solution and ran the
  complete test suite (all green); verified the built `EliteSharp.dll`'s
  `ProductVersion` reads `0.0.0-alpha.0.<height>+<sha>` as expected pre-tag.

### Added (Scripted input + frame dump in the real SDL apps, 2026-07-22)

- The headless harnesses cover the common case, but the rare check that
  must exercise the true SDL window/present path still meant OS-level
  focus stealing and key injection to verify live. `GameHost.Run`
  (shared by both games) now supports two environment-variable-gated
  debug facilities, so default behaviour with neither var set is
  unchanged: `GAME_KEY_SCRIPT` (a file path, or the script text itself)
  is parsed by the new `SharpKind.Input.KeyScriptParser` and replayed
  into the real keyboard sink tick-by-tick by the new
  `KeyScriptPlayer`, and `GAME_FRAME_DUMP_DIR` enables both an F12
  debug key and the script's `SaveFrame` command, both of which dump
  the current native-resolution framebuffer there as a BMP via a new
  `IGraphics.SaveScreen(path)` (implemented on `SoftwareGraphics` by
  writing its back buffer directly, and on `SDLGraphics` via
  `SDL_RenderReadPixels`, plus no-ops/recording on the two `IGraphics`
  test fakes). `KeyScriptEvent`/`KeyScriptAction` moved from
  `SharpKind.Fakes.Harness` (test-only) to `SharpKind.Input` (production)
  so both the headless harnesses and this real-app player share one
  definition instead of two; `KeyScriptAction` gained a `SaveFrame`
  member. Added `KeyScriptParserTests`, `KeyScriptPlayerTests`, and a
  `SoftwareGraphics.SaveScreen` round-trip test. Verified live: ran
  both apps with a scripted key file and `GAME_FRAME_DUMP_DIR` set, no
  OS focus/injection involved, and confirmed the dumped BMPs
  (640x400/512x512) show the correct rendered frame (SCR's track menu,
  Elite's intro/parade screen) with clean logs. Built the full solution
  and ran the complete test suite (all green).

### Added (Elite headless game harness + shared harness base, 2026-07-22)

- Added the Elite equivalent of SCR's `HeadlessGameHarness`, building on
  `EliteMainTests`' DI-composed construction/smoke test: drives the same DI
  graph `SDLProgram.Main` does (`AddEliteConfig` + `AddEliteMain`) with
  `FakeAbstraction` wrapping a real `SoftwareGraphics` (no SDL window) and
  calls `EliteMain.Update`/`Draw` directly per tick — `EliteMain.Run` is
  unusable headlessly as-is, since it hands off to `GameHost.Run`'s
  real-time, wall-clock-waiting loop. Added an internal `EliteMain.State`
  property exposing `GameState` (which stays internal) for the harness to
  read, mirroring `StuntCarRacerMain.Screens`/`Race`.
- Writing it alongside SCR's existing harness surfaced straight
  copy-pasted code (`KeyScriptEvent`, `KeyScriptAction`, and the
  tap/hold/release scripting loop in `Step`/`Run`/`SaveFrame`) that would
  only have grown more duplicated as more games got one. Extracted the
  shared parts into `SharpKind.Fakes`
  ([Harness/HeadlessGameHarnessBase.cs](src/useful/test/SharpKind.Fakes/Harness/HeadlessGameHarnessBase.cs),
  `KeyScriptEvent.cs`, `KeyScriptAction.cs`, new `SharpKind.Fakes.Harness`
  namespace; added a `SharpKind.Graphics` project reference to `SharpKind.Fakes`
  for `SoftwareGraphics`/`BitmapWriter`): a public generic
  `HeadlessGameHarnessBase<TState>` owns the `SoftwareGraphics`, the
  scripted-input `Step`/`Run` loop, and `SaveFrame`, via two abstract hooks
  (`UpdateGame`/`DrawGame`) and an abstract `State` property. Both games'
  `HeadlessGameHarness` classes now just build their own object graph
  (Elite's DI container vs SCR's direct constructor) and supply their own
  `GameStateSummary` shape — genuinely different per game, so those stay
  local — while `KeyScriptEvent`/`KeyScriptAction` and the harness
  machinery are defined exactly once. Verified with a throwaway test that
  the Elite harness still renders a real frame (cockpit/HUD/scanner) before
  deleting it. Built the full solution and ran the complete test suite
  (all green, same pass counts as before the refactor); no production
  behaviour changed beyond the new `EliteMain.State` accessor, so no live
  smoke test was needed.

### Added (BitmapWriter + BitmapReader rename in SharpKind.Graphics, 2026-07-22)

- `BitmapFile.Read` was the only half of a load/save pair, and the
  BMP-dumping code duplicated itself across both games' `VisualDumpTests`.
  Renamed `BitmapFile` to `BitmapReader`
  ([BitmapReader.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.Graphics/BitmapReader.cs),
  updating its `SoftwareGraphics.Create` call sites and test file to
  match) and added `BitmapWriter.Write`
  ([BitmapWriter.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.Graphics/BitmapWriter.cs)): a
  standard 32bpp `BITMAPV5HEADER` BGRA bottom-up BMP, padded to
  `BitmapReader`'s fixed pixel-data offset so a written file reads back
  correctly, and valid enough to open in an ordinary image viewer too.
  Both games' `VisualDumpTests` and SCR's new `HeadlessGameHarness` (see
  below) now call the shared `BitmapWriter.Write` instead of a
  hand-rolled 24bpp `SaveBmp` each maintained separately. Added
  `BitmapWriterTests.cs` (signature/length check, a round trip through
  `BitmapReader` with distinct per-corner colours incl. alpha, and a
  non-square bitmap) alongside the renamed `BitmapReaderTests.cs`. Also
  tidied `BitmapReader.Read` while it was open: it allocated a fresh
  byte array per field, including a `new byte[4]` for *every pixel* in
  the double loop; switched to `BinaryPrimitives.ReadInt32/16LittleEndian`
  reading spans of the original buffer directly (zero allocation, and it
  now applies the correct endian handling to width/height/bit-depth too,
  not just pixel colour as before). Replaced the `Debug.Assert` on the
  "BM" signature — compiled out in Release, so a non-BMP file would
  silently misparse instead of failing — with a thrown `UsefulException`,
  matching the existing bit-depth check. Built the full solution and ran
  the complete test suite (all green).

### Added (Reusable headless SCR game harness, 2026-07-22)

- Verifying a change against the running game meant driving the real SDL
  window with OS-level focus stealing and key injection — slow and flaky
  for agent-driven sessions, and `VisualDumpTests` only exercises
  hand-composed scenes, not the whole game (screens, HUD, menu flow).
  Added `HeadlessGameHarness` to `StuntCarRacerSharpLib.Tests`
  ([HeadlessGameHarness.cs](src/scr/test/StuntCarRacerSharpLib.Tests/HeadlessGameHarness.cs)):
  runs the real `StuntCarRacerMain` against a real `SoftwareGraphics` (no
  SDL window), generalising `StuntCarRacerMainTests.StartRace`'s manual
  key-press sequence into a scripted `KeyScriptEvent` timeline (tap/hold/
  release at a given tick), and exposes a `GameStateSummary` (current
  screen, race started, player/opponent track piece, distance to
  opponent) so most checks never need a rendered frame — `SaveFrame` is
  there for the rare case that does (calling the shared `BitmapWriter`
  above). Added `HeadlessGameHarnessTests.cs` covering the initial menu
  state, driving menu→race via a scripted timeline, and a frame dump
  smoke test. Built the full solution and ran the complete test suite
  (all green); no production code changed, so no live smoke test was
  needed.

### Added (EliteMain construction/smoke test using fakes, 2026-07-22)

- Elite had no test that even constructed its composition, unlike SCR's
  `StuntCarRacerMainTests`. Added `EliteMainTests.cs`
  ([EliteMainTests.cs](src/elite/test/EliteSharpLib.Tests/EliteMainTests.cs)):
  builds the same DI graph `SDLProgram.Main` does
  (`AddEliteConfig`+`AddEliteMain`) with a new `FakeAbstraction` swapped in
  for `IAbstraction` (no SDL window/sound device/keyboard needed) and the
  real `AssetLocator`/shipped assets otherwise, then resolves `EliteMain`
  and runs one `Update()` tick, asserting it doesn't throw and
  `IsRunning` stays true. Added `FakeAbstraction` to `EliteSharpLib.Fakes`
  (mirroring SCR's), and gave the shared `FakeGraphics`
  ([FakeGraphics.cs](src/useful/test/SharpKind.Graphics.Fakes/FakeGraphics.cs))
  an optional width/height constructor (default 0, unchanged for existing
  callers) — `Stars.CreateNewStar` derives its random ranges from
  `EliteDraw.Centre`, which comes from `IGraphics.ScreenWidth/Height`, and a
  0x0 fake screen produced a negative range that threw; `FakeAbstraction`
  now sizes it 512x512 to match Elite's real resolution. Built the full
  solution, ran the complete test suite (all green, 396 tests across the
  solution including the new test), and smoke-tested the live app.

### Added (SpaceTests covering Space's flight/hyperspace/docking logic, 2026-07-22)

- `Space` ([Space.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Space.cs)) was the last
  class named by the "Elite's core game logic is largely untested" backlog
  item — notably `LaunchPlayer`'s `LegalStatus |= _trade.IsCarryingContraband()`
  line, where "the contraband bug lived here for years." Added
  `SpaceTests.cs` (26 tests) covering `LaunchPlayer` (contraband carried over
  into `LegalStatus`, clean without contraband, flight state + undocking),
  `DockPlayer` (docks, resets ship speed and weapons), `JumpWarp` (mass-locked
  by a non-exempt object present, mass-locked with no planet, clamps the jump
  to 1024 and moves every object), `StartHyperspace`/`StartGalacticHyperspace`
  (fuel/equipment/already-ready guards), `CountdownHyperspace` (decrements,
  and completes a galactic jump at zero), `EngageDockingComputer` (docking
  view only with a station present) and `UpdateAltitude`/`UpdateCabinTemp`
  (safe defaults in witchspace/without a planet or sun, the near-body
  distance formula, the fuel-scoop temperature band, and the too-close/too-hot
  game-over paths). Added `FakeView` to `EliteSharpLib.Fakes` (a no-op `IView`)
  so tests can register the `Docking`/`GameOver`/`Hyperspace` screens that
  `GameState.SetView` requires. `UpdateUniverse` (the per-frame object
  update/render loop) is not covered here — it's exercised indirectly by the
  existing visual-dump/smoke tests rather than unit-level assertions. Built
  the full solution, ran the complete test suite (all green, 80 in
  `EliteSharpLib.Tests` including the 26 new tests).

### Added (PlanetControllerTests covering the pure-logic galaxy/planet generation code, 2026-07-22)

- `PlanetController` ([PlanetController.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/PlanetController.cs))
  had no test coverage — part of the "Elite's core game logic is largely
  untested" backlog item, which also named `SaveFile` round-trip coverage as
  a starting point; that round trip already exists in `SaveFileTests`
  (`SaveCommanderThenLoadCommanderRoundTrips`), as does coverage for `Combat`,
  `ConfigFile` and `RNG.GenerateRandomNumber` (`CombatTests`,
  `ConfigFileTests`, `RNGTests`), so only `PlanetController` was still
  missing. Added `PlanetControllerTests.cs` covering
  `CalculateDistanceToPlanet` (zero for the same planet, symmetric),
  `GeneratePlanetData` (deterministic from seed), `WaggleGalaxy`
  (deterministic, fields stay byte-ranged over many iterations),
  `NamePlanet` (deterministic, doesn't mutate its input seed),
  `FindPlanetNumber` (matches a galaxy waggled that many times, -1 when not
  found), `FindPlanetByName` (finds/fails by name) and `DescribeInhabitants`
  (Human Colonials below seed byte E 128, alien description above). `Space`
  remains untested and stays on the backlog. Built the full solution, ran
  the complete test suite (all green, 54 in `EliteSharpLib.Tests` including
  the 14 new tests).

### Fixed (AssetLocator.Create no longer exclusively locks AssetManifest.json, 2026-07-21)

- `AssetLocator.Create()` ([AssetLocator.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.Assets/AssetLocator.cs))
  opened `AssetManifest.json` via `File.Open(path, FileMode.Open)`, which
  defaults to `FileAccess.ReadWrite`/`FileShare.None` — an exclusive lock for
  a read-only operation. Two concurrent callers (e.g. two test classes each
  constructing their own `AssetLocator`/`SoftwareGraphics` in parallel xUnit
  collections) could race and throw `IOException` on the file, wrapped as
  `UsefulException`. Found while adding `EliteDrawTests.cs` alongside the
  existing `VisualDumpTests.cs`, both of which call `AssetLocator.Create()`.
  Now opens with `FileAccess.Read, FileShare.Read`. Verified with an ad hoc
  8-way concurrent `AssetLocator.Create()` probe run 5 times alongside
  `VisualDumpTests` (no failures pre-fix reproduced it, post-fix all green);
  probe was throwaway and not committed. Built the full solution, ran the
  complete test suite (all green).

### Fixed (EliteDraw.DrawTextPretty no longer underflows on a word longer than the line width, 2026-07-21)

- `DrawTextPretty` ([EliteDraw.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Graphics/EliteDraw.cs)) scanned
  backward from the line-width breakpoint for a space/comma/period with no
  lower bound; a word longer than the available width (no break character
  anywhere in range) walked the index past 0 and threw
  `IndexOutOfRangeException`. The backward scan now stops at `previous`, and
  when no break character is found in range the word is hard-broken at the
  line-width boundary instead. Added `EliteDrawTests.cs` covering a 200-character
  unbreakable word. Built the full solution, ran the complete test suite (all
  green, 41 in `EliteSharpLib.Tests` including the new test).

### Fixed (Sanitize SaveFile.SaveCommander's filename and log its save failures, 2026-07-21)

- `SaveFile.SaveCommander` ([SaveFile.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Save/SaveFile.cs))
  built the save path as `save.CommanderName + ".cmdr"` from raw user input —
  invalid filename characters threw and path separators could escape the save
  directory. `PathFor` (shared by both `LoadCommander` and `SaveCommander`) now
  replaces any character in `Path.GetInvalidFileNameChars()` with `_` before
  combining it into a path. Also converted `SaveCommander`'s two
  `Debug.WriteLine`/`Debug.Fail` catch blocks to the `ILogger<SaveFile>`
  `LoadCommander` started using in the previous entry, adding a
  `FailedToSaveCommander` `LogMessages` entry following the same
  `GameOverView`/`Combat` exemplar. Added `SaveFileTests.cs` coverage for a
  commander name containing `../` path separators, asserting the save stays
  inside the save directory as a single file. Built the full solution, ran the
  complete test suite (all green, 40 in `EliteSharpLib.Tests` including the
  new test).

### Fixed (SaveFile.LoadCommander no longer throws on a corrupt or hand-edited save, 2026-07-21)

- `SaveFile.LoadCommander` ([SaveFile.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Save/SaveFile.cs))
  caught its own failures, reset `_lastSaved` to Jameson, then `throw;`ed —
  contradicting its `bool`-return contract and `LoadCommanderView`'s
  "Error Loading Commander!" path, which never ran. Worse,
  `SaveStateToGameState` indexes `GalaxySeed[0..5]`, `CurrentCargo[i]`,
  `StationStock[i]` and `Lasers[0..3]` and `Enum.Parse`s `EnergyUnit`/
  `LaserType` with no validation, so a truncated or hand-edited `.cmdr`
  file threw `IndexOutOfRangeException`/`FormatException` there instead.
  Added `IsValidSave`, checking the array lengths `SaveStateToGameState`
  assumes and that both enum strings parse, following `ConfigFile<T>.ReadConfig`'s
  read-validate-fallback shape ([ConfigFile.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind/Config/ConfigFile.cs));
  `LoadCommander` now validates before calling `SaveStateToGameState`,
  returns `false` on any read/parse/validation failure, and resets to
  Jameson without rethrowing. `SaveFile` takes an optional
  `ILogger<SaveFile>` (defaulting to `NullLogger<SaveFile>.Instance`,
  the `GameOverView`/`Combat` exemplar), and the removed `Debug.WriteLine`
  is now a Warning via two new `LogMessages` entries
  (`FailedToLoadCommander`, `CommanderValidationFailed`).
  `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions.AddEliteMain` passes
  `ILoggerFactory.CreateLogger<SaveFile>()` through.
  `SaveCommander`'s two `Debug.WriteLine`/`Debug.Fail` catch blocks are
  unchanged — tracked as a separate backlog item since they're a save,
  not a load, and the fix there is a different shape (sanitizing the
  filename). Added `SaveFileTests.cs`
  ([SaveFileTests.cs](src/elite/test/EliteSharpLib.Tests/Save/SaveFileTests.cs))
  covering a missing save file, corrupt JSON, a truncated `galaxySeed`
  array, and a save/load round trip. Built the full solution, ran the
  complete test suite (all green, 39 in `EliteSharpLib.Tests` including
  the 4 new ones), and smoke-tested the built Elite app — it starts and
  constructs its full DI graph (including the changed `SaveFile`
  constructor) without error.

### Fixed (Stop swallowing input/console errors in EliteMain.Update, 2026-07-21)

- `EliteMain.Update` wrapped `_scanner.UpdateConsole()` and
  `_gameState.CurrentView!.HandleInput()` in a `catch (Exception) { Debug.WriteLine(...) }`
  ([EliteMain.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/EliteMain.cs)), so in Release
  builds (where `Debug.WriteLine` compiles away) every error from either call
  was silently swallowed each tick, violating the architecture doc's "never
  catch-all on the frame path" rule. Removed the catch-all: `SDLProgram.Main`
  ([SDLProgram.cs](src/elite/apps/EliteSharp/SDLProgram.cs)) already wraps
  `elite.Run()` in a try/catch that logs Critical via Serilog and rethrows,
  and the whole game loop runs synchronously on that same thread
  (`GameLoop.Run` → `GameHost.Run` → `EliteMain.Run`, no background thread),
  so any exception now surfaces there with a full stack trace instead of
  vanishing.

### Changed (Let SoftwareGraphicsBenchmarks take CLI filter/job arguments, 2026-07-21)

- `SharpKind.Graphics.Benchmarks`'s `Program.Main`
  ([Program.cs](src/useful/perf/SharpKind.Graphics.Benchmarks/Program.cs)) called
  `BenchmarkRunner.Run<T>()` directly, so `dotnet run -c Release` always ran
  all 23 benchmarks under the full `DefaultConfig` job (~10 minutes) with no
  way to narrow it down — the friction that made the clip-region regression
  above expensive to chase down. Switched to
  `BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(...).Run(args, config)`, which accepts
  `--filter`/`--job`/etc.; verified that plain `dotnet run -c Release` (no
  arguments) still runs every benchmark under the same `DefaultConfig` job
  as before — `BenchmarkSwitcher` prompts interactively when given no
  arguments even with a single benchmark class in the assembly, so `Main`
  now substitutes `--filter *` in that case to keep today's default
  behaviour. Local iteration on a change can now run in seconds instead of
  minutes, e.g. `dotnet run -c Release -- --filter *DrawPixel* --job dry`.
  Also switched the job's toolchain to `InProcessNoEmitToolchain`: the
  default out-of-process toolchain generates and builds a throwaway project
  per run, and BenchmarkDotNet resolves it by scanning the whole repo tree
  for a matching project *name* — which throws `NotSupportedException` the
  moment more than one copy exists on disk, as happens when a Claude Code
  isolated-worktree agent's checkout sits nested under
  `.claude/worktrees/*` inside the same repo. Running in-process sidesteps
  the lookup entirely (and removes the per-run build step, on top of the
  `--filter`/`--job` speedup above), at the cost of slightly less isolation
  between iterations than a separate process gives — an acceptable trade
  for a suite whose numbers are read as relative comparisons rather than
  absolute ones. `SharpKind.Input.Benchmarks` and `EliteSharpLib.Benchmarks`
  have the same hardcoded-`Main` pattern and would benefit from the same
  change; not done here since neither was needed for this investigation.

### Fixed (Implement SoftwareGraphics.SetClipRegion, 2026-07-21)

- `SoftwareGraphics.SetClipRegion`
  ([SoftwareGraphics.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.Graphics/SoftwareGraphics.cs))
  was an empty no-op, while Elite actively relies on clip regions
  (`EliteDraw.SetViewClipRegion`) to keep view drawing inside the border and
  off the scanner area — in the software renderer this protection silently
  did nothing. Added a clip rectangle (defaulting to the full screen) that
  both `DrawPixel` overloads test against, and routed
  `DrawRectangleFilledInt`/`DrawRectangleInt` (which wrote straight to the
  backing bitmap) through the clipped `DrawPixel` too, so every pixel-writing
  path is now covered. A same-toolchain A/B benchmark of the first pass
  showed this cost real per-pixel throughput — the private `DrawPixel(int,
  int, uint)` had previously been a bare `_screen.SetPixel` passthrough with
  no checks at all, so `DrawLine`/`DrawCircleFilled`/`DrawRectangle*` (all of
  which funnel through it per pixel) roughly doubled. Added a
  `_clipIsFullScreen` flag, true whenever the clip covers the whole screen
  (the default, and where most frames spend most of their time — e.g. Elite
  only narrows the clip for the 3D view); both `DrawPixel` overloads check it
  first and skip straight to the cheap unclipped path when it's set, only
  paying the four-field clip comparison while a narrower clip is actually
  active. Re-running the same A/B afterwards showed the regression cut from
  ~100% down to ~10-25% (a few nanoseconds) on the affected benchmarks — the
  remaining cost being the one unavoidable guard branch. Added
  `SetClipRegionRestrictsPixelWritesToRegion`,
  `SetClipRegionRestrictsRectangleFilledToRegion` and
  `SetClipRegionBackToFullScreenRestoresUnclippedDrawing` in
  `SoftwareGraphicsTests`. Verified live against the real `EliteDraw` render
  path (mirroring `EliteMain.Update`'s clip/border/clip-to-view sequence): a
  full-screen rectangle drawn under the view clip stayed off both the border
  and the scanner area. Built the full solution and ran the complete test
  suite (all green).

### Fixed (Bound the text bitmap cache with LRU eviction, 2026-07-21)

- `SoftwareGraphics._textCache`
  ([SoftwareGraphics.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.Graphics/SoftwareGraphics.cs))
  cached one bitmap per distinct (font, colour, text) forever, and Elite
  renders ever-changing strings (bounty amounts, countdowns), so long
  sessions leaked memory steadily. The cache is now a bounded
  (`TextCacheCapacity` = 256) LRU: a `LinkedList` tracks recency, hits move
  their node to the front, and once full the least-recently-used bitmap is
  disposed and evicted before a new one is added. Added
  `GenerateTextBitmapCachesAndEvictsLeastRecentlyUsed` in
  `SoftwareGraphicsTests`, exercising a real font asset. Built the full
  solution and ran the complete test suite (all green).

### Fixed (Stop disposing cached text bitmaps on every draw, 2026-07-21)

- `DrawTextCentre`/`DrawTextLeft`/`DrawTextRight`
  ([SoftwareGraphics.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.Graphics/SoftwareGraphics.cs))
  wrapped the bitmap returned by `GenerateTextBitmap` in `using`, but that
  same bitmap is stored in `_textCache` and handed back again on the next
  call with the same (font, colour, text) — so every cached bitmap was
  disposed (its `GCHandle` freed) right after its first use, working today
  only because text drawing never reads `FastBitmap.BitmapHandle`. Removed
  the `using`s; cached bitmaps are now disposed only when
  `SoftwareGraphics.Dispose()` runs, alongside the screen bitmap. Built the
  full solution and ran the complete test suite (all green).

### Changed (Share injectable randomness between Elite and SCR, 2026-07-21)

- Elite's `RNG` and SCR's `CarPhysics`/`OpponentPhysics` each had their own
  ad-hoc take on injectable randomness (see the entry below for Elite's), and
  SCR's `CarPhysics` had none at all (`private readonly Random _random =
  new(0);`, no constructor seam). The generic part is now a shared
  `SharpKind.IRandomSource`/`SharpKind.RandomSource` (`NextInt`/`Random`/
  `TrueOrFalse`/`GaussianRandom`, wrapping an injected `System.Random`), with
  a `SharpKind.Fakes.FakeRandomSource` that returns fixed, test-set values so a
  test can force an exact branch (e.g. "the 1-in-256 roll succeeds")
  without hunting for a seed. `EliteSharpLib.RNG` keeps only what's
  genuinely Elite-specific — `Seed`, `GenerateRandomNumber` (6502),
  `GenMSXRandomNumber` (MSX) — composing a `RandomSource` for everything
  else; its `RNG(Random random)` constructor (and every existing DI
  registration/consumer/test) is unchanged, plus a new `RNG(IRandomSource
  randomSource)` overload lets tests inject a `FakeRandomSource` directly.
  `CarPhysics`/`OpponentPhysics` (and the `Race`/`StuntCarRacerMain` chain
  that builds them) now take `IRandomSource` via constructor injection, with
  a convenience overload defaulting to an unseeded `RandomSource` so the
  ~30 existing `new(track)`-style test call sites didn't need to change.
  `StuntCarRacerServiceCollectionExtensions.AddScrRandom` registers the
  `Random`/`IRandomSource` singletons (mirroring
  `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions`); `SDLProgram.cs` switched
  `StuntCarRacerMain`'s registration to an explicit factory, since an
  implicit-constructor-selecting `AddSingleton<StuntCarRacerMain>()` would
  now tie between two equally-resolvable two-argument constructors.
  Added `EliteSharpLib.Tests/RNGTests.cs`, `CombatTests.cs` (Combat had zero
  tests before this), and `FakeRandomSource`-driven branch tests in
  `ShipFactoryTests.cs`; added the same for `CarPhysicsTests.cs`
  (`EngineFluctuation`/`OffRoadPitch`, previously either untested or only
  range-asserted) and `OpponentPhysicsTests.cs` (opponent-selection roll).
  Built the full solution, ran the complete test suite (all green, 35
  EliteSharpLib.Tests + 184 StuntCarRacerSharpLib.Tests), and smoke-tested both
  `EliteSharp` and `StuntCarRacerSharp` launching and running cleanly.

### Changed (Replace the static crypto RNG with an injected, seedable service, 2026-07-21)

- `RNG` ([RNG.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/RNG.cs)) was a static class
  whose `Random(...)` delegated every call to
  `RandomNumberGenerator.GetInt32` — cryptographically secure but far
  slower than needed in Elite's hot per-tick paths — and whose `Seed`
  state was static mutable, making the 6502/MSX planet-description
  generators untestable and coupling every caller to global state. `RNG`
  is now an instance class constructed from an injected `System.Random`,
  registered as a singleton in `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions` (a
  fresh `Random` in production, seedable in tests) alongside the
  `Random` singleton itself, per the architecture doc's "randomness is
  always an injected, seedable source, never a static mutable RNG"
  rule. Every consumer (`Combat`, `Space`, `Stars`, `Universe`,
  `Pilot`, `EliteDraw`, `LaserDraw`, `ShipFactory`/`ShipBase` and all
  30 ship subclasses, `PlanetFactory`/`FractalPlanet`,
  `SunFactory`/`GradientSun`/`SolidSun`, the four `Pilot*View`s,
  `GameOverView`, `PlanetDataView`, `EscapeCapsuleView`) now takes
  `RNG` by constructor injection instead of calling the static class.
  Built the full solution, ran the complete test suite (all green),
  and smoke-tested `EliteSharp` launching and running cleanly.

### Changed (Remove two-phase construction from SDLSound/SoftwareGraphics, 2026-07-21)

- `SDLSound` required a separate `Initialize(assetLocator)` call after
  construction to load music/sfx — `SDLAbstraction`
  ([SDLAbstraction.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.SDL/SDLAbstraction.cs)) had
  silently skipped that call, so any code path through it would have thrown
  `KeyNotFoundException` the first time it tried to play a sound.
  `SDLSound`'s constructor now takes `IAssetLocator` directly and loads
  music/sfx itself ([SDLSound.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.SDL/SDLSound.cs));
  both `SDLAbstraction` and `SoftwareAbstraction`
  ([SoftwareAbstraction.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.SDL/SoftwareAbstraction.cs))
  updated to pass the asset locator in. `SoftwareGraphics.Fonts`/`Images`
  ([SoftwareGraphics.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.Graphics/SoftwareGraphics.cs))
  were `internal`-settable properties populated after construction via an
  object initializer in `Create`, leaving them mutable by any other code in
  the assembly afterwards (the benchmark project did exactly that); they are
  now get-only, assigned once in the constructor, with `Create` computing
  the dictionaries before calling it. `ShipFactory.Create`
  ([ShipFactory.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Ships/ShipFactory.cs)) set
  its `_ships` field the same way via an object initializer on a
  parameterless-constructed instance — private, so not the same
  half-built-instance risk, but the same pattern; it now takes the built
  dictionary through a private constructor instead. Built the full
  solution, ran the complete test suite (all green), and smoke-tested both
  `EliteSharp` and `StuntCarRacerSharp` launching cleanly.

### Changed (IKeyboard split into producer/consumer interfaces, 2026-07-21)

- `IKeyboard` ([IKeyboard.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.Input/IKeyboard.cs)) mixed
  the producer API (`KeyDown`/`KeyUp`/settable `Close`, written by `SDLInput`
  as raw key events arrive) with the consumer API (`IsPressed`/`IsHeld`/
  `LastPressed`/`ClearPressed`/`Poll`/readable `Close`, polled by games) —
  game code holding an `IKeyboard` had no way to be stopped from also
  injecting key events. Split the producer side into a new
  `IKeyboardSink` ([IKeyboardSink.cs](src/useful/libs/SharpKind.Input/IKeyboardSink.cs));
  `IKeyboard` keeps the consumer API with `Close` now read-only.
  `SoftwareKeyboard` and `FakeKeyboard` implement both interfaces
  unchanged; `IInput.Register` (and its `SDLInput`/`FakeInput`/benchmark
  implementations) now take `IKeyboardSink` instead of `IKeyboard`.
  `IAbstraction.Keyboard` stays `IKeyboard`, so no game/view code changed.
  Built the full solution and ran the complete test suite (all green).

### Changed (SCR screens given their real dependencies, 2026-07-21)

- Every SCR screen (`RaceScreen`, `TrackMenuScreen`, `TrackPreviewScreen`,
  `GameOverScreen`) took the whole `StuntCarRacerMain` and reached through
  it service-locator style. Extracted a new `Race`
  ([Race.cs](src/scr/libs/StuntCarRacerSharpLib/Race.cs)) that owns the
  track/car/opponent/bridge state, its renderers, and the
  `LoadTrack`/`PhysicsDue`/`DrawWorld`/`DrawHud`/`UpdateSounds`/
  `UpdateEngineSound` behaviour that operates on them; `StuntCarRacerMain`
  now keeps only the run loop, screen wiring and audio setup. Each screen's
  constructor now takes `Race` plus the specific stable dependencies it
  actually uses (`IKeyboard`, `ScreenManager<GameMode, IGameScreen>`,
  `IGraphics`, `ScrPalette`, `ISound`) instead of the whole game object, so
  dependencies are visible in the constructor signature. Built the full
  solution, ran the complete test suite (all green, including
  `StuntCarRacerSharpLib.Tests`' 180 tests), and smoke-tested the built SCR app
  (starts and constructs its full DI graph, including `Race` and all four
  screens, without error).

### Added (Remaining EliteSharpLib Debug calls converted to logging, 2026-07-21)

- The last scattered `Debug.Fail`/`Debug.WriteLine` calls outside
  `Combat` are converted: `Space`'s three "Failed to create Planet/Sun"
  `WriteLine`s ([Space.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Space.cs)) and one
  each in `ConstrictorMissionView`, `EscapeCapsuleView`, `Intro1View`,
  `Intro2View` — all legitimate runtime conditions (universe full) — now
  log a Warning via the existing `LogMessages.FailedToCreateShip`, same
  as the `GameOverView`/`Combat` exemplars. `Intro2View`'s parade-ship
  failure now logs the specific ship's name instead of a fixed
  "first Parade ship" string. `Space` and the four views all take an
  optional `ILogger<T>` (defaulting to `NullLogger<T>.Instance`) through
  their constructors, and `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions` resolves
  `ILoggerFactory` to pass each one through. This closes out the
  EliteSharpLib logging backlog item — every operational `Debug.*` call
  in the library is now converted. Built the full solution, ran the
  complete test suite (all green), and smoke-tested the built Elite app
  (starts, logs "Starting Elite - The Sharp Kind", and constructs its
  full DI graph — including every changed class — without error).

### Added (Combat's Debug.Fail calls converted to logging/exceptions, 2026-07-21)

- `Combat` was the heaviest concentration of `Debug.Fail` calls in
  `EliteSharpLib` (17, [Combat.cs](src/elite/libs/EliteSharpLib/Conflict/Combat.cs)),
  none of which survive a Release build. `Combat` now takes an optional
  `ILogger<Combat>` (defaulting to `NullLogger<Combat>.Instance`,
  following the `GameOverView` exemplar), and the 16 "Failed to create
  &lt;ship&gt;" cases — all legitimate runtime conditions (universe full)
  — log a Warning via the existing `LogMessages.FailedToCreateShip`.
  "Incorrect loot type" was a programming-error case (an unreachable
  `ShipType` branch), so it now throws `EliteException` instead —
  `LaunchLoot`'s if/else-if chain became a switch expression to keep the
  analyzer happy with the added throw arm.
  `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions.AddEliteMain` now resolves
  `ILoggerFactory` and passes `CreateLogger<Combat>()` through. Built the
  full solution, ran the complete test suite (all green), and
  smoke-tested the built Elite app (starts and constructs its full DI
  graph, including `Combat`, without error).

### Added (EliteSharpLib logging infrastructure + exemplar, 2026-07-21)

- `EliteSharpLib` had no way to log at all — every operational failure in
  the library went to `Debug.WriteLine`/`Debug.Fail`, which vanish in
  Release builds. Added a library-internal `LogMessages`
  `[LoggerMessage]` partial (`EliteSharpLib/LogMessages.cs`), following
  the same pattern as `SharpKind.Config.LogMessages` and the apps'
  `LogMessages.cs`. `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` was
  already referenced by `EliteSharpLib.csproj`, and `ILoggerFactory` was
  already registered in the DI container (`SDLProgram`/
  `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions`), so only the per-consumer wiring
  was new.

  Proved the pattern end-to-end on `GameOverView` as the exemplar (a
  small, low-risk view with two `Debug.WriteLine("Failed to create
  ...")` calls): it now takes an optional `ILogger<GameOverView>`
  constructor parameter, defaulting to `NullLogger<GameOverView>.Instance`
  for tests/fakes, and logs both "failed to create ship" cases as a
  Warning (legitimate runtime condition — universe full — not a
  programming error) via `LogMessages.FailedToCreateShip`.
  `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions.AddEliteMain` now resolves
  `ILoggerFactory` and passes `CreateLogger<GameOverView>()` through.

  The remaining Debug.WriteLine/Debug.Fail call sites across `Combat`,
  `Space`, and the other four views convert in follow-up backlog items
  using this same infrastructure. Built the full solution, ran the
  complete test suite (all green), and smoke-tested the built Elite app
  (starts and constructs its full DI graph, including `GameOverView`,
  without error).

### Added (ConfigFile logs failures through the app's logger, 2026-07-21)

- `ConfigFile<T>`'s read/write failures went to `Debug.WriteLine` only,
  so nothing appeared in the Serilog file/console sinks the apps
  actually use — a purposefully-broken config (e.g. an invalid enum
  string) produced no trace in the log file at all, only in an attached
  debugger's Output window. `ConfigFile<T>` now takes an optional
  `ILogger<ConfigFile<T>>` (constructor overload, defaulting to
  `NullLogger<ConfigFile<T>>.Instance` — same pattern the backlog's
  library-logging item describes for `ILogger<T>` adoption) and a new
  library-internal `LogMessages` `[LoggerMessage]` partial
  (`SharpKind/Config/LogMessages.cs`) logs:
  - a Warning "Failed to read config file '{path}'; using defaults." —
    always visible at the apps' default Information level, no exception
    attached (so no stack-trace noise by default);
  - a separate Debug-level message carrying the actual exception, so the
    full stack trace only appears once `ELITE_LOG_LEVEL`/`SCR_LOG_LEVEL`
    is raised to `Debug`;
  - a Warning when the config fails validation (no exception, nothing
    was thrown);
  - an Error (with exception) on `WriteConfig` failure, alongside the
    existing `Debug.Fail` dev-time assertion (left as-is — orthogonal to
    logging).

  `AddEliteConfig`/`AddScrConfig` now resolve `ILoggerFactory` from the
  container (already registered by both `SDLProgram`s) and pass a
  `CreateLogger<ConfigFile<T>>()` logger through; `SharpKind`,
  `EliteSharpLib` and `StuntCarRacerSharpLib` each gained a
  `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions` package reference for
  this. `IsValidConfig` stayed `internal` (was already made so for the
  earlier DRY-unification tests) so `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions`
  can pass it as the validation predicate unchanged.

  Reproduced the exact reported scenario (`{"PlanetStyle": "QWERTY"}`)
  against the built app: at the default level the log file now shows
  `[WRN] Failed to read config file '...'; using defaults.` with no
  stack trace; with `ELITE_LOG_LEVEL=Debug` the full exception chain
  (down to `ConfigurationBinder.Bind`) appears too. Added
  `SharpKind.Tests` coverage (`RecordingLogger<T>` fake — Moq's generic
  `ILogger.Log<TState>` verification is awkward, a fake is simpler)
  asserting the Warning+Debug split on read failure and the
  no-exception Warning on validation failure.

### Changed (Logs moved under the shared TheSharpKind user-data folder, 2026-07-21)

- Both apps' Serilog file sink used a `logs` path relative to the
  process's current working directory, so where log files actually
  landed depended on how the app was launched (repo root via `dotnet
  run`, or next to the exe when run directly) — inconsistent with the
  config files, which are already rooted at a fixed
  `%AppData%\TheSharpKind`. `SDLProgram.Main` in both apps now computes
  `userDataPath` first and points the file sink at
  `Path.Combine(userDataPath, "logs", "elite-.log")` /
  `"scr-.log"`, so logs always land at
  `%AppData%\TheSharpKind\logs\` (`~/.config/TheSharpKind/logs/` on
  Linux/macOS) regardless of launch method. Serilog's file sink creates
  the `logs` subdirectory itself, same as it always has.

  Smoke-tested both built apps: confirmed `elite-<date>.log`/
  `scr-<date>.log` now appear under the shared user-data folder. Docs
  (`elite-readme.md`, `scr-readme.md`) updated to mention log location
  alongside the existing config-file description.

### Changed (Config file handling unified into a generic SharpKind type, 2026-07-21)

- Elite's `ConfigFile`/`IConfigWriter` and SCR's `ScrConfigFile` were
  near-identical (JSON read/write via `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`,
  same defaults-on-failure behaviour, same catch clauses) except for their
  settings type and filename — a DRY violation now that both games have
  one. Replaced both with a single generic `SharpKind.Config.ConfigFile<T>`
  (`where T : new()`), implementing a new generic `IConfigWriter<T>`, with
  the filename passed to the constructor and an optional
  `Func<T, bool> isValid` predicate for game-specific validation (Elite's
  `Fps > 0`/enum-range checks; SCR has none). `EliteSharpLib`'s
  `ConfigSettings` and `StuntCarRacerSharpLib`'s `ScrConfigSettings` stay put
  (they're genuinely game-specific), now bound as `ConfigFile<ConfigSettings>`
  / `ConfigFile<ScrConfigSettings>` respectively — `AddEliteConfig`/
  `AddScrConfig` and `SettingsView` (now `IConfigWriter<ConfigSettings>`)
  updated accordingly. `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`/`.Binder`/
  `.Json` package references moved from `EliteSharpLib.csproj`/
  `StuntCarRacerSharpLib.csproj` to `SharpKind.csproj`, the only project that now
  uses them directly.

  Adding those packages to `SharpKind` exposed a latent naming collision:
  `SharpKind.Maths.Extensions` triggered CA1724 (type name conflicts with
  the newly-referenced `Microsoft.Extensions` namespace) under this
  repo's warnings-as-errors build. Renamed it to `MathsExtensions` (pure
  rename — it's an extension-method container, so no call site needed
  updating) to unblock the build; unrelated to the config unification
  itself but a direct consequence of it.

  Added generic coverage in `SharpKind.Tests/Config/ConfigFileTests.cs`
  (defaults-when-missing, round-trip, mistyped-value fallback, failing
  validation) covering the shared logic once; `EliteSharpLib.Tests`/
  `StuntCarRacerSharpLib.Tests` keep their own `ConfigFileTests` but only for
  wiring specific to their real settings type/filename (Elite's also
  exercises the actual `IsValidConfig` predicate, now `internal` for
  testability). Full solution build and test suite pass; smoke-tested
  both built apps to confirm the DI wiring still resolves and runs.

### Fixed (Config parse failures crashed the game at startup, 2026-07-21)

- `ConfigFile.ReadConfig`/`ScrConfigFile.ReadConfig` only caught
  `IOException`/`UnauthorizedAccessException`/`FormatException` around
  `IConfiguration.Bind`, but `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder`
  wraps type-conversion failures (e.g. a hand-edited `elitesharp.cfg`
  with a non-boolean string for `ShipWireframe`) in
  `InvalidOperationException`, not `FormatException` — so a corrupt or
  hand-edited config file crashed the whole game with an unhandled
  exception instead of falling back to defaults as intended. Both catch
  clauses now also match `InvalidOperationException`. Also tightened
  both `SDLProgram.Main`s: `GetRequiredService<EliteMain>()`/
  `<StuntCarRacerMain>()` (which triggers `ReadConfig` as part of DI
  composition) previously ran *before* the surrounding try/catch, so any
  composition-time exception bypassed the apps' own
  `LogMessages.CriticalAppTerminated` logging and crashed silently
  instead; moved the call inside the try block for both apps.

  Reproduced the exact reported crash (`elitesharp.cfg` containing
  `{"ShipWireframe": "hello!"}`) against the built app before and after
  the fix; added `ConfigFileTests`/`ScrConfigFileTests` regression cases
  covering the mistyped-value scenario, plus default-when-missing and
  write/read round-trip coverage that didn't exist for either config
  file before.

### Changed (Shared TheSharpKind user-data folder, 2026-07-21)

- Both apps' `userDataPath` (`SDLProgram.cs`) moved from their own
  per-game folder (`%AppData%\EliteSharp`, `%AppData%\StuntCarRacerSharp`) to
  a shared `%AppData%\TheSharpKind`, since they're both part of the same
  project. Elite's config filename (`elitesharp.cfg`) and commander
  saves (`.cmdr`) already avoided any collision by name, so it needed no
  change; SCR's config filename gained a `sharp` suffix
  (`stuntcarracer.cfg` → `stuntcarracersharp.cfg`) to stay unambiguous
  now it sits next to Elite's files in the same folder. Docs
  (`elite-readme.md`, `scr-readme.md`) updated to match and cross-link
  each other's Configuration section, now that the folder is shared.

### Added (SCR persisted settings, 2026-07-21)

- Gave SCR its own settings file, mirroring Elite's `ConfigFile`/
  `ConfigSettings` pattern: a new internal `ScrConfigSettings`/
  `ScrConfigFile` (`StuntCarRacerSharpLib/Config`) reads/writes
  `MusicOn`/`EffectsOn` to a JSON file (`stuntcarracersharp.cfg`) rooted
  at a user-data path, and a public
  `StuntCarRacerServiceCollectionExtensions.AddScrConfig(userDataPath)`
  (mirroring `AddEliteConfig`) registers it in DI and exposes the result
  as `SharpKind.Audio.AudioOptions` — the type `StuntCarRacerMain` already
  took at its `AudioController` construction site. `StuntCarRacerMain`
  gained a new public constructor overload accepting `AudioOptions` (the
  existing no-option constructors now default to `new()`, unchanged
  behaviour); `SDLProgram` wires `AddScrConfig` in ahead of the
  `StuntCarRacerMain` registration, same as Elite's `SDLProgram`.

  Skipped a settings-screen UI to write the file, following the same
  precedent as Elite's `ShipRenderMode` setting (2026-07-20): SCR has no
  settings screen at all today, so the config file remains the only way
  to change these values (still satisfies "toggle without code
  changes"). `FrameGap` and league selection stay out of scope, per the
  backlog item, as future candidates once a settings screen exists.

  Smoke-tested the built app: it starts, creates the shared user-data
  directory, and reads a hand-written config file
  (`MusicOn`/`EffectsOn` both `false`) without error. Added
  `ScrConfigFileTests` (default-when-missing, write/read round-trip) and
  two `StuntCarRacerMainTests` cases for the new constructor overload.

### Changed (Colour handling unified on FastColor, 2026-07-20)

- Phase 3 of unifying colour handling across Elite and SCR: `uint` →
  `FastColor` across the shared colour contract — `IGraphics` (and both
  implementations, `SoftwareGraphics`/`SDLGraphics`), `IPolygonRenderer`
  and its three strategies (`ZBufferRenderer`/`PainterRenderer`/
  `WireframeRenderer`), `IPaletteCollection`/`Palette`/`PaletteReader`
  (`SharpKind.Assets.Palettes`), `Face.Color` (`SharpKind.Assets.Models`), and
  SCR's `WorldPolygon.Colour`/`CarPalette`. Only the declared surfaces
  changed — internal call sites across Elite's ~110 `uint`-typed colour
  locals/fields (Views, Planets, Suns, Ships) and SCR's `ScrPalette`/
  `TrackRenderer` kept compiling unchanged via the implicit `uint`↔
  `FastColor` conversions added earlier the same day (see below), keeping
  the diff to 27 files. The exceptions needing edits were Moq test
  matchers (`It.IsAny<uint>()` → `It.IsAny<FastColor>()`), since Moq
  checks the literal parameter type rather than tolerating implicit
  conversions.

  Also resolves the open `[SharpKind.SDL] ToSDLColor decodes the colour as
  RGBA` defect: `ToSDLColor` now decodes via `FastColor.R`/`G`/`B`/`A`
  instead of hand-rolled bit-shifts, matching `SetRenderDrawColor` and
  every other colour in the codebase (ARGB).

### Changed (ScrPalette loaded from palette.json, 2026-07-20)

- Phase 2 of the colour-handling unification: `ScrPalette`'s hardcoded
  42-entry `uint[]` replaced with a JSON asset
  (`StuntCarRacerSharpLib/Assets/Palette/palette.json`) loaded through
  `SharpKind.Assets.Palettes.PaletteReader`/`IPaletteCollection` — the same
  mechanism `EliteDraw` already used for its named palette. `Colour(int)`
  stays static with a lazily-loaded backing store and keeps addressing
  colours positionally (`Track.ScrBaseColour + offset`, matching the
  original's `SCR_BASE_COLOUR`-relative scheme) rather than converting to
  an injected instance: `RoadTextures.Textures` resolves colours in a
  static field initializer at type-load time, and ~20 call sites across 8
  files address colours by numeric offset, so DI injection here would
  have meant a much larger, riskier change for the same goal.

### Changed (FastColor moved into the base SharpKind library, 2026-07-20)

- Phase 1 of the colour-handling unification: `FastColor`/`BaseColors`
  relocated from `SharpKind.Graphics` into the base `SharpKind` library, so
  `SharpKind.Assets` (which sits below `SharpKind.Graphics` in the dependency
  graph and owns `IPaletteCollection`/`Face.Color`) can reference it in a
  later phase without a circular project reference. No call-site changes
  needed elsewhere — `SharpKind.Graphics`/`SharpKind.SDL` already see it via
  C#'s enclosing-namespace lookup. Added implicit `uint`↔`FastColor`
  conversions so existing ARGB literals and `uint`-typed fields kept
  compiling as call sites migrated to `FastColor` over the subsequent
  phases above.

### Changed (CarMesh converted to a car.obj asset, 2026-07-20)

- SCR's `CarMesh` (the opponent's wedge-body/wheel-quad geometry,
  previously hardcoded vertex/quad arrays) now loads from a Wavefront OBJ
  asset (`StuntCarRacerSharpLib/Assets/Models/car.obj`), mirroring how Elite
  loads its ship models via `SharpKind.Assets.Models.ModelReader`. `CarMesh`
  changed from a static class to an instance constructed once (and
  injected into `OpponentRenderer`) instead of re-parsed on every track
  load; a new `CarPalette` resolves car.obj's five materials to
  track-palette colours since `Track.ScrBaseColour` is presently a fixed
  offset. Also fixed `.gitignore`'s blanket `*.obj` rule, which was
  silently excluding the new `car.obj` — only Elite's ship-model path was
  carved out as a genuine-OBJ exception; added SCR's models path
  alongside it.

### Changed (Polygon renderers moved to SharpKind.Graphics, 2026-07-20)

- `IShipRenderer`, `ShipRenderMode`, `PolygonData`, `WireframeRenderer`,
  `PainterRenderer` and `ZBufferRenderer` moved from
  `EliteSharpLib.Graphics` to `SharpKind.Graphics.Rendering`
  (`src/useful/libs/SharpKind.Graphics/Rendering/`) — after today's earlier
  work stripped their last Elite dependencies (`GameState`, the
  `ShipWireframe` check), none of the six referenced anything
  Elite-specific anymore; they only depend on `IGraphics`,
  `IAssetLocator` and `PaletteReader`, all already public in `SharpKind.*`.
  Renamed the two type names that said "ship": `IShipRenderer` →
  `IPolygonRenderer`, `ShipRenderMode` → `PolygonRenderMode`
  (`SubmitFace`/`faceColor` → `Submit`/`color` too, and
  `PolygonData.FaceColor` → `Color`); the three renderer classes
  (`WireframeRenderer`/`PainterRenderer`/`ZBufferRenderer`) didn't
  mention ships in their names already, so those stayed as-is. Elite's
  `ConfigSettings.ShipRenderMode` *property* keeps its name — that's
  Elite's own config key, just typed by the now-shared enum.
  `IShipRenderer`/the three renderer classes were `internal`; became
  `public` since Elite now consumes them from a different assembly
  (`PolygonData` stayed `internal`, used only inside the two chain-based
  renderers). Picked up two analyzer fixes moving to a fresh project
  (`CA1062` null-checks on the newly-public constructor/`Submit`
  parameters, `IDE0290` primary constructors) that hadn't fired while
  the types were `internal` to `EliteSharpLib`.

  Checked `StuntCarRacerSharpLib` for anything that duplicates this
  chain/depth-sort logic and could reuse it: no — `TrackRenderer`/
  `OpponentRenderer` submit `WorldPolygon`s straight to
  `Graphics.DrawPolygonFilledDepth` with no buffering step, so there's
  nothing to swap over, though `ZBufferRenderer` is the closer relative
  if SCR ever wants the explicit start/submit/end lifecycle. Also
  checked the rest of this session's changes (`AudioOptions`,
  `ConfigSettings`/`ConfigFile`) for the same "no longer game-specific"
  smell — `AudioOptions` was already correctly in `SharpKind.Audio`;
  `ConfigSettings`/`ConfigFile` hold genuinely Elite-only fields
  (`PlanetStyle`, `SunStyle`, the `elitesharp.cfg` filename) and stay put.

### Added (Selectable ship render mode, 2026-07-20)

- Last of the ship-rendering-strategy items: `ZBufferRenderer` and
  `PainterRenderer` are now purely filled renderers — the `ShipWireframe`
  branch (and the `GameState`/`IAssetLocator` dependencies it needed for
  the white outline colour) is gone from both, so `ZBufferRenderer`'s
  constructor is just `(IGraphics)` now and `PainterRenderer`'s
  unchanged. A new `WireframeRenderer` (`Graphics/WireframeRenderer.cs`)
  handles outline mode instead: since line order doesn't affect the
  result, it draws each submitted face immediately in `SubmitFace`
  rather than buffering a depth-sort chain at all. A new
  `ConfigSettings.ShipRenderMode` (`ShipRenderMode.Painter`/`ZBuffer`,
  defaulting `ZBuffer` — the current behaviour) selects between the two
  filled strategies; `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions`'s `IShipRenderer`
  registration now picks `WireframeRenderer`, `PainterRenderer`, or
  `ZBufferRenderer` based on `ShipWireframe`/`ShipRenderMode` at
  composition time, same as `Enum.IsDefined` validation as the other mode
  enums in `ConfigFile.IsValid`.

  Skipped the literal `FilledRenderer` wrapper the backlog item named:
  `ZBufferRenderer`/`PainterRenderer`, once stripped of their wireframe
  branch, already fully implement `IShipRenderer` as pure filled
  renderers, so a forwarding decorator would have added a class with no
  behaviour of its own. Also skipped a `SettingsView` toggle for the new
  setting — `ShipWireframe` itself has no in-game UI today either, so the
  config file remains the only way to switch (still satisfies "toggle
  without code changes").

  Added `VisualDumpTests.PainterAndZBufferRenderIdenticallyForNonDecalGeometry`,
  rendering a decal-free `Asteroid` model through both filled strategies
  and asserting pixel-for-pixel equality (passes exactly, no tolerance
  needed) — confirms the split didn't change either algorithm's actual
  behaviour. Also visually spot-checked `WireframeRenderer`'s output
  (a clean white ship outline, as expected).

### Changed (Z-buffer ship renderer renamed, 2026-07-20)

- Third of the ship-rendering-strategy items: `ShipRenderer` (the
  combined depth-sort/fill/wireframe behaviour extracted from `EliteDraw`
  earlier today) renamed to `ZBufferRenderer`, matching the
  `PainterRenderer` sibling added alongside it — no behaviour change,
  same registration in `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions.AddEliteMain`
  and the same direct construction in `PlanetBenchmarks`,
  `SunBenchmarks` and `VisualDumpTests`. The backlog item also asked to
  carry `ShipBase`'s face-root decal-inheritance logic
  (`FindFaceRoots`/`FaceMeanZ`) into this class; that logic stayed in
  `ShipBase` instead, deliberately deviating from the item's literal
  text — it computes the `z` value every `IShipRenderer.SubmitFace` call
  receives regardless of which strategy is active (`PainterRenderer`
  depends on the exact same computation), so moving it into
  `ZBufferRenderer` specifically would make `ShipBase` need to know which
  renderer is currently selected to compute a face's depth key, which
  defeats the point of the `IShipRenderer` abstraction landed earlier
  today. The open decal-seam defect this logic has (some decals lose to
  their base face at certain angles, from the 2026-07-14 z-buffer spike)
  is unchanged and untouched by this rename.

### Added (Painter's-algorithm ship renderer, 2026-07-20)

- Second of the ship-rendering-strategy items: a new
  `PainterRenderer : IShipRenderer` (`Graphics/PainterRenderer.cs`)
  restores the pre-2026-07-14-spike behaviour — a plain
  (non-depth-tested) `Graphics.DrawPolygonFilled` fill in back-to-front
  `_polyChain` order, instead of `ShipRenderer`'s per-pixel z-buffer test
  (`Graphics.DrawPolygonFilledDepth`) — as its own selectable
  implementation, without touching `ShipBase`'s face-transform code.
  Deliberately duplicates `ShipRenderer`'s chain-management code rather
  than factoring out a shared base class now, since the z-buffer item
  (still open) may reshape `ShipRenderer` further; `PainterRenderer` also
  skips the per-vertex `Depths` array entirely since the painter's fill
  never reads it. Not yet registered in the DI container — `ShipRenderer`
  stays the sole active implementation until the wireframe/filled item
  wires up config-driven selection between them. Verified with a
  throwaway test rendering the same interpenetrating-hulls scene as
  `VisualDumpTests`; both single-ship and intersecting-hull frames looked
  correct on visual inspection (not a pixel diff against the z-buffer
  path — that comparison is the wireframe/filled item's job).

### Added (Ship-rendering strategy abstraction, 2026-07-20)

- First of the ship-rendering-strategy items (backlog): a new internal
  `IShipRenderer` (`SubmitFace`/`StartFrame`/`EndFrame`,
  `Graphics/IShipRenderer.cs`) isolates the depth-sort/fill algorithm
  from `EliteDraw`, which previously hardcoded the back-to-front
  `_polyChain` chain and the `ShipWireframe` render-mode branch directly
  in `DrawPolygonFilled`/`RenderStart`/`RenderEnd` — the same fields the
  2026-07-14 z-buffer spike edited in place rather than toggled. Today's
  exact combined behaviour (chain, z-buffer fill, wireframe branch) moved
  unmodified into a new `ShipRenderer : IShipRenderer`
  (`Graphics/ShipRenderer.cs`); `PolygonData` moved into the same
  `Graphics` namespace/folder since it's now `ShipRenderer`-only.
  `EliteDraw`'s constructor takes an injected `IShipRenderer` and its
  three methods just delegate to it now. Registered as a singleton in
  `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions.AddEliteMain`, resolved before
  `EliteDraw`. This is pure extraction, not a split — the actual
  painter's/z-buffer/wireframe/filled separation is the three remaining
  backlog items. `PlanetBenchmarks`, `SunBenchmarks` and
  `VisualDumpTests` construct `EliteDraw` directly (not via DI) and
  needed a `ShipRenderer` passed in too; visually spot-checked its
  `frame_interpenetrate.bmp` dump (the two-hulls-intersecting per-pixel
  depth test) and it renders correctly, though this wasn't a pixel diff
  against a pre-change baseline.

### Added (Injectable AudioController options, 2026-07-20)

- `AudioController`'s `_musicOn`/`_effectsOn` were hardcoded `true` behind
  a pointless `#if DEBUG`/`#else` with identical branches; the constructor
  now takes a new `SharpKind.Audio.AudioOptions` (`MusicOn`/`EffectsOn`, both
  defaulting `true`) instead. Elite's `ConfigSettings` gained matching
  `MusicOn`/`EffectsOn` properties (default `true`, no behaviour change),
  and `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions`'s `AudioController` registration
  now builds the options from the already-resolved `GameState.Config`
  rather than a second `ConfigFile.ReadConfig()` call. SCR
  (`StuntCarRacerMain`) has no settings infrastructure at all yet, so it
  passes a plain default `AudioOptions` at its construction site — same
  always-on behaviour as before, just explicit instead of hardcoded
  inside `AudioController`. Added `PlayEffectDoesNothingWhenEffectsAreOff`
  and `PlayMusicAndStopMusicDoNothingWhenMusicIsOff` to
  `AudioControllerTests`, which needed `FakeSound.Play(string, bool)`/
  `StopMusic()` to actually count calls (previously no-ops).

### Added (Elite view registrations in the container, 2026-07-20)

- The last composition-root item: `EliteMain` no longer constructs its ~25
  `IView` screens itself. Each view (`Intro1View` through `GameOverView`)
  is now registered as a singleton in a new private
  `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions.AddEliteViews`, resolved by factory
  delegate for the same internal-accessibility reason as the domain
  services. `AddEliteMain`'s `EliteMain` factory now populates the
  `ScreenManager<Screen, IView>` singleton (`views.Add(Screen.X, ...)` for
  all 25 screens) by resolving each view from the container before
  constructing `EliteMain` — this has to happen there rather than inside
  `AddEliteViews` itself, since IServiceCollection registration is lazy
  and population needs actual built instances. `EliteMain`'s constructor
  shrinks accordingly: `Trade`, `PlanetController`, `IShipFactory`,
  `ConfigFile` and `ScreenManager<Screen, IView>` are all gone from its
  parameter list (they were only ever used to build views), leaving just
  the collaborators its `Update`/`Draw`/`Run` logic actually touches.

### Added (Elite domain services in the container, 2026-07-20)

- `EliteMain`'s constructor no longer builds its own domain graph: `GameState`,
  `PlayerShip`, `Trade`, `PlanetController`, `EliteDraw` (as `IEliteDraw`),
  `IShipFactory` (via `ShipFactory.Create`), `Universe`, `Stars`, `Pilot`,
  `Combat`, `SaveFile`, `Space`, `Scanner`, `AudioController` and the
  `ScreenManager<Screen, IView>` backing `GameState` are all now registered
  as singletons in `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions.AddEliteMain` (which
  also forwards `AssetLocator` as `IAssetLocator`), and `EliteMain`'s
  constructor just receives them. Since every one of these types is
  `internal` to `EliteSharpLib`, the container can't auto-wire them by
  reflection (that only sees public constructors), so each is registered via
  an explicit factory delegate rather than a bare `AddSingleton<T>()` — this
  is deliberately verbose over hiding it behind a bigger, riskier
  internal-to-public accessibility change. The `AudioController` `SfxSample`
  cooldown table (`// TODO: improve this`) moved into a private
  `BuildEliteSfx` helper alongside the other registrations, unchanged.
  `EliteDraw`'s `_colorText = _draw.Palette["White"]` read and `SaveFile`'s
  `ConfigFile.BaseDirectory` path both stay exactly where they were,
  now sourced from the injected `IEliteDraw`/`ConfigFile`.
  `EliteMain` still builds the ~25 views itself — that's the next backlog
  item.

### Added (Elite composition root, 2026-07-20)

- Mirrors the SCR composition root: `EliteSharp.SDLProgram.Main` builds a
  `ServiceCollection` instead of `new`-ing `SoftwareAbstraction` and
  `EliteMain` directly, registering `IAbstraction` and its forwarded
  `IGraphics`/`ISound`/`IKeyboard`, the Serilog `ILoggerFactory`, and
  `AssetLocator`. `ConfigFile` (and `EliteMain` itself, whose constructor
  now takes it) are `internal` to `EliteSharpLib` with no
  `InternalsVisibleTo` for the `EliteSharp` app, so `Program.Main` can't
  register or construct them directly; new `EliteServiceCollectionExtensions`
  in `EliteSharpLib` adds `AddEliteConfig(userDataPath)` and `AddEliteMain()`
  extension methods that do this from inside the assembly that can see
  those types, and registers `EliteMain` as `IGame` too. `EliteMain`'s
  constructor now takes `AssetLocator`/`ConfigFile` as parameters instead
  of creating them (the user-data path moved out to `Program.Main`, with
  `ConfigFile` gaining an internal `BaseDirectory` property so `EliteMain`
  can still build `SaveFile`'s path from it), and is `internal` rather
  than `public` since only the in-assembly registrar factory calls it
  now. `EliteMain`'s constructor otherwise keeps building the rest of the
  domain graph as before — that's the separate "move Elite's domain
  services into the container" item.

### Added (SCR composition root, 2026-07-20)

- `StuntCarRacerSharp.SDLProgram.Main` now builds a `ServiceCollection`
  (`Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`, newly referenced by the
  `StuntCarRacerSharp` project) instead of `new`-ing `SoftwareAbstraction` and
  `StuntCarRacerMain` directly: `SoftwareAbstraction` is registered as
  `IAbstraction` via a factory (container-owned and disposed with the
  provider), `IGraphics`/`ISound`/`IKeyboard` are forwarded from it, the
  existing Serilog-backed `ILoggerFactory` is registered as an instance,
  and `StuntCarRacerMain` is registered as itself and as `IGame`. `Main`
  resolves the concrete `StuntCarRacerMain` (not `IGame`, which has no
  `Run`) and calls `.Run()`. This is the first of the composition-root
  items — Elite's `Program.Main` mirrors the pattern next.

### Added (SCR per-effect sound volume/pitch/pan, 2026-07-20)

- Sound effects now vary per play instead of always sounding identical,
  matching the Amiga original's `DSSetMode`/`DrawDustClouds`/`DrawSparks`/
  `UpdateDamage` behaviour: Creak and Grounded volume scale with impact
  damage (`CarPhysics.CalculateDamageVolume`, shared by both, matching
  the original's identical formula in both places), and the off-road/
  edge-scrape sounds are pitched (randomly for off-road, by speed for
  the edge scrape) instead of playing at a flat pitch. Each effect also
  gets the original's fixed stereo pan (engine and Smash left,
  everything else right) and HitCar's fixed quieter volume.
  `SharpKind.Audio` grew the plumbing for this: `ISound.Play` and
  `AudioController.PlayEffect` take volume/pan/pitch, `SfxSample` carries
  a per-effect static volume/pan profile, and `SDLSound` implements
  pitch-shifted one-shots with the same resample-on-a-reserved-channel
  technique the engine loop already used (a new second reserved channel,
  stopping after one pass instead of looping). Elite's 9 `PlayEffect`
  call sites are unaffected (same simple no-args overload).
  Deliberate deviations: skips the original's `AmigaVolumeToDirectX` dB
  round-trip since SDL_mixer's volume is already linear (see
  `CalculateDamageVolume`'s comment for the maths); the two pitched
  effects have no "recorded rate" reference in the original either (both
  always override the frequency), so pitch=1.0 is anchored at each
  formula's own range midpoint (464 for off-road, 360 for the edge
  scrape) rather than a verified original value. Covered by new
  `AudioControllerTests` (volume/pan/pitch pass-through) and
  `CarPhysicsTests` (damage-scaled volume in range, off-road/wreck pitch
  in the derived ranges); actual audio output was not manually verified
  by ear.

### Added (SCR lap times, 2026-07-20)

- The dashboard now shows a current-lap clock and best-lap time
  (`T0:00.00`/`B0:00.00`, `M:SS.CC`), mirroring the Amiga original's
  `print.lap.time`/`show.lap.time` read-outs. `CarPhysics` tracks
  `CurrentLapTicks` (advanced once per 50Hz `ApplyEngineRevs` tick,
  the same hook the wheel-spin-rate fix uses) and `BestLapTicks`
  (updated and the current lap reset at each lap boundary in
  `UpdateLapData`); `HudRenderer` formats ticks as `M:SS.CC` and draws
  them beside the existing lap/boost/distance read-outs. Deliberate
  deviation: this is a straightforward wall-clock timer, not a port of
  the original's 3-byte BCD stopwatch, whose exact increment/wrap
  semantics were not fully reverse-engineered from the raw disassembly
  (ptitSeb never implements this feature, so there is no clean C++
  reference to check against). The follow-up "BCD fidelity" backlog
  item was closed won't-fix 2026-07-20: without a working emulator to
  verify the exact wrap semantics against, chasing byte-for-byte
  fidelity risks silently reproducing a misread of the disassembly,
  and the current wall-clock-accurate timer is arguably the more
  useful behaviour anyway. Dashboard placement is a
  reasonable slot (confirmed to fit an existing empty panel via
  `VisualDumpTests`), not verified against the original's exact
  layout. Covered by new `CarPhysicsTests` (tick advance only via
  `ApplyEngineRevs`, reset on new race, full-lap best-time recording)
  and a `HudRendererTests` case for the current/best text.

### Fixed (SCR cockpit wheel-spin rate, 2026-07-20)

- Cockpit front wheel sprites were spinning at a quarter of their
  correct rate: the wheel-angle advance lived in `CarMovement`, which
  only runs every `FrameGap`-th tick (12.5Hz), instead of the original
  `FramesWheelsEngine`'s full 50Hz rate. Split `SetWheelRotationSpeed`
  into a physics-rate speed calculation (unchanged) and a new
  `AdvanceWheelAngles`, now called from `CarPhysics.ApplyEngineRevs` —
  already the 50Hz hook, called every tick from `RaceScreen.Update` —
  keeping the original's right-wheel-reads-left-angle quirk. Covered by
  a new `CarPhysicsTests.WheelAnglesAdvanceOnEveryEngineRevsTickNotJustPhysicsFrames`
  test that drives `ApplyEngineRevs` alone (no physics frames) and
  checks the wheel frame moves.

### Changed (SCR full damage wrecks the car, 2026-07-20)

- `CarPhysics.Wrecked` now goes true when `NewDamage` reaches 240,
  matching the Amiga original's `damage.line`/`car.is.wrecked` (the HUD
  crack previously just capped out with no effect). The C# port already
  carried the rest of the Amiga's (and ptitSeb's dormant, never-triggered)
  wreck plumbing — `_wreckWheelHeightReduction`, the wheel-height
  subtraction, the `!Wrecked`-gated engine power/boost cuts, and the
  scrape-sound gate — so the only change is setting that field once the
  damage threshold is crossed; those existing paths do the rest. The race
  flow is otherwise unchanged (the opponent still finishes and the race is
  lost). Covered by new `CarPhysicsTests` (`FullDamageWrecksTheCar`,
  `PartialDamageDoesNotWreckTheCar`, `WreckedResetsOnNewRace`).

### Changed (SCR opponent speed values, 2026-07-19)

- The opponent's per-piece required speeds are now computed by a port of
  ptitSeb's `Opponent_Speed_Value()` (itself derived from the Amiga's
  `opponents.speed.values` creation assembly) instead of the old
  fluffyfreak per-track random tables: a per-track random mask and base
  from the full 64-byte `opp_track_speed_values` table (now carried
  verbatim in `OpponentData.TrackSpeedValues`, super-league rows
  included for the future Super League item), ten faster on sections
  the car can be put on, memoized so the value only re-rolls when the
  opponent changes piece. Two deliberate choices beyond the reference:
  the can-be-put-on test uses bit 7 as the Amiga's `bpl` does (ptitSeb
  tests `b < 0` on an unsigned value, which never fires), and the draw
  bridge's `SetSpeedValue` writes still take precedence via a per-piece
  override (the Amiga modified its precomputed table; ptitSeb's own
  writes go unread since nothing reads the table any more — a
  regression not copied). Covered by new `SpeedValue` unit tests
  (deterministic standard-league values, RNG-stream stability while on
  a piece, draw-bridge override precedence) and smoke-tested live.

### Audited (SCR ptitSeb parity, 2026-07-19)

- Ran a full feature-by-feature comparison of the C# port against
  `ptitSeb/stuntcarremake` (see the backlog's "Resolved (2026-07-19) —
  ptitSeb parity audit" note for the findings). One backlog item was
  found already complete and removed: **opponent name announcement** —
  `StuntCarRacerMain.DrawHud` has shown "Opponent: <name>" for the
  first four seconds of a race since the atlas HUD work (commit
  2a476b4); the remaining gaps were re-verified and tightened into
  discrete backlog items (wreck-at-full-damage plumbing references,
  wheel-spin tick rate, sound frequency/volume/pan table, mid-race 'M'
  side effects, and the unplugged racewin/racelost/wrecked/heads art
  screens).

### Fixed (Elite ship rendering, 2026-07-14)

- Elite's ships now render through the shared software z-buffer
  (`DrawPolygonFilledDepth`, the path Stunt Car Racer already used)
  instead of pure painter overdraw, fixing the long-standing "bits of
  hidden surfaces show through" artefact — with the max-Z face sort
  (checked against The New Kind's `threed.c`: `zavg` = MAX is
  authentic, not a porting bug), far-side decals and detail lines beat
  near hull faces that wrap toward the tail. Each face now rasterizes
  with one flat per-pixel depth: the mean Z of its "root" face's
  transformed points. `ShipBase` computes face roots once per instance
  from the model geometry — decal faces (cockpit windows, engine
  plates) and 2-point detail lines lie exactly (distance 0.000) in the
  plane of an earlier larger face and inherit that face's key, so they
  tie exactly and the chain's later-submission tie order draws them on
  top, the convention the models were built for. Flat rather than
  interpolated per-vertex depth is deliberate: measurement showed the
  rasterizer's clamped edge interpolation deviates from a coplanar
  face's plane by far more than any safe bias, punching seam-shaped
  holes through decals (Transporter panel, Cobra engine plates).
  Wireframe mode is unchanged apart from the sort key. This supersedes
  the backlog defect about the `zavg` max-vs-mean sort. Verified with a
  new `VisualDumpTests` that renders lone-ship, decal-heavy
  (Transporter spin, rear Cobra) and overlap/interpenetration scenes
  through the real rasterizer to BMPs for visual inspection.

### Changed (user data location, 2026-07-12)

- `ConfigFile` and `SaveFile` (`.cmdr` commander saves) now resolve their
  files against an injected base directory instead of the current working
  directory. `EliteMain` computes the default once
  (`%AppData%\EliteSharp` on Windows, `~/.config/EliteSharp` on
  Linux/macOS via `Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData`) and passes
  it to both, fixing the "launched from a shortcut" breakage where the CWD
  wasn't the app's install directory, and making both classes testable
  against a temp directory. The shipped default `elitesharp.cfg` next to
  the executable is no longer read and was removed.

### Changed (config, 2026-07-12)

- `ConfigFile.ReadConfig` now reads `elitesharp.cfg` (renamed from
  `sharpkind.cfg`) through
  `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`'s JSON provider (bound onto
  `ConfigSettings`) instead of `System.Text.Json.Deserialize`, with startup
  validation (`Fps > 0` and each enum value in range) falling back to
  defaults on failure. Writing now goes behind a new `IConfigWriter`
  interface, which `SettingsView` depends on instead of the concrete
  `ConfigFile`.

### Fixed (logging, 2026-07-12)

- Both apps' logs were invisible without a debugger (Serilog's only sink was
  `Debug`, minimum level Verbose). Switched to a console sink plus a rolling
  daily file (`logs/elite-.log` / `logs/scr-.log`, 7 days retained), minimum
  level Information, overridable via the `ELITE_LOG_LEVEL` /
  `SCR_LOG_LEVEL` environment variables.

### Fixed (SCR track rendering, 2026-07-12)

- Track visibility artifacts (white triangles on corners, triangular bites
  in the track edges up close, spurious triangles on the side walls, torn
  bottom edge): the painter's sort (one averaged depth per segment) was
  replaced with a software z-buffer in `SoftwareGraphics`
  (`ClearDepth`/`DrawPolygonFilledDepth`/`DrawPolygonTexturedDepth`, 1/z
  depth test, perspective-correct textured fill), matching the original
  remake's Direct3D z-buffered `DrawTrack`; `Scene3D` now clips in float at
  the remake's 0.5-unit near plane instead of the Amiga fixed-point
  engine's integer `Z_CLIP_BOUNDARY = 128`. Also closes the backlog's
  "near-road sliver artifact" defect (no longer reproduces in
  `VisualDumpTests` frames) and obsoletes its `TrackRenderer`
  double-transform cleanup item (that code path was removed).
- View dipping under the track surface on bumpy landings: ported the
  remake's `LimitViewpointY` (road "tearing" prevention) into `CarPhysics`
  and wired it into `SceneCamera.FollowCar`, with unit tests.

### Removed

- Dead NAudio-backed audio stack: `SoftwareSound`, `SoundSampleProvider`
  and `PitchedLoopSampleProvider` had zero production references since
  `SoftwareAbstraction` switched to `SDLSound`, and `AudioController`'s
  `GenerateWaveFromMidi`/`WriteStereoWav` helpers were never called; deleted
  along with the `NAudio`/`NAudio.Vorbis`/`MeltySynth` package references in
  `SharpKind.Audio.csproj` and `EliteSharpLib.csproj`.

### Fixed (2026-07-11 architecture review — all Must items, plus one Should)

- Cross-platform audio: `SoftwareAbstraction` now uses the SDL_mixer-backed
  `SDLSound` instead of NAudio's Windows-only `WaveOutEvent`, fixing startup
  on Linux/ARM64. Follow-ups fixed in the same pass: mixer channel count
  raised 2 → 16 with channel 0 reserved for the engine loop (overlapping
  effects no longer crash with "No free channels available"), a dropped
  one-shot effect is no longer treated as fatal, and pitch-shifted looping
  was implemented in `SDLSound` via a `Mix_RegisterEffect` resampler
  (mirroring `PitchedLoopSampleProvider`'s algorithm) so SCR's engine sound
  works on all platforms.
- `SDLInput` no longer force-quits on Escape — quit policy belongs to each
  game, and Elite's ESC = launch escape capsule works again. Window close
  (`SDL_QUIT`) still exits.
- Elite contraband calculation counted Slaves twice and Narcotics never;
  now `(slaves + narcotics) * 2 + firearms` per the original, with unit
  tests.
- A missing or malformed `sharpkind.cfg` no longer crashes Elite at
  startup; it falls back to default settings.
- `SDLSound.Dispose` freed music/sfx handles with the wrong SDL_mixer APIs
  and double-freed music; now `Mix_FreeMusic` for music, `Mix_FreeChunk`
  for effects, once each.
- `SoftwareGraphics` rectangle drawing clamped Y against the screen *width*
  and overshot by one pixel — out-of-bounds crash / wrong-row artifacts on
  non-square screens (SCR is 640x400). Regression tests added.
- `FastBitmap.Resize` read one row/column past the source bitmap when
  growing. Tests added.
- `Space.JumpWarp` crashed with a NullReferenceException in witchspace
  (no planet/sun) once all Thargoids were destroyed.

### Added

- Root `README.md` landing page linking both games, docs and changelog.
- Consolidated all planning docs (`issues.md`, `release-plan.md`,
  `scr-conversion-plan.md`) into a single TODO list at
  `docs/review-findings.md`; folded `config.md` into the Elite readme;
  renamed `docs/readme.md` → `docs/elite-readme.md` and
  `docs/images/screenshot.png` → `elite-screenshot.png`.
- Business-application practices section in `docs/architecture-principles.md`
  (composition root/DI, logging, configuration, error handling, lifetimes,
  testability seams).

## Stunt Car Racer conversion — progress to date

Summarised from the retired `scr-conversion-plan.md` "Done" list. Remaining
conversion work now lives in the [backlog](docs/backlog-roadmap.md).

- Project skeleton (`src/scr/*`) wired into the solution; builds clean.
- Track geometry/data model from the original Amiga track data, including
  the draw bridge animation.
- Car physics (fixed-point, ported from the original 68000 algorithms):
  sound triggers, car-to-car collision/slipstream, wheel rotation/bounce,
  smash-hole tracking; `DisplaySpeed` matches ptitSeb's revised formula.
- Opponent AI: scripted speeds, wheel-spring dynamics, steering,
  obstruct/push/move-aside interaction, lap counting and win calculation.
- 3D projection/camera pipeline (`Scene3D`, `SceneCamera`, `ScrPalette`)
  with flat-shaded and textured polygons via `SharpKind.Graphics`.
- Backdrop/horizon/scenery rendering, five scenery types, N cycles them.
- Car mesh (wheels + wedge body) used to draw the opponent.
- HUD: bitmap-font text overlays plus the graphical cockpit dashboard
  ported from ptitSeb's `DrawCockpit`, sprited from one converted
  `atlas.bmp` via the new `IGraphics.DrawImagePart`.
- Track menu background drawing ptitSeb's `menu.png` over the 3D world.
- Sound via `SharpKind.Audio`: variable-pitch engine loop, effect triggers,
  samples converted to WAV assets.
- Game-mode/screen flow (TrackMenu, TrackPreview, Race, GameOver) with
  camera orbit/preview logic and track selection; full game loop wired up,
  all eight tracks drivable end-to-end, keyboard-controlled.
- Fixed-timestep game loop, screen state machine and sound-effect
  throttling shared with Elite (`SharpKind.Timing.GameLoop`,
  `ScreenManager<TId, TScreen>`, `AudioController`/`SfxSample`).
- Floating-track and spurious-triangle rendering bugs fixed with
  regression coverage; road-line textures regenerated from the palette and
  textured onto the road ±11 segments around the player.
- Control scheme rewritten to match ptitSeb (independent
  accelerate/brake/boost), fixing two pre-existing shared keyboard bugs on
  the way (wrong SDL Right-Arrow mapping; one-shot `IsPressed` breaking
  continuous controls — added non-consuming `IKeyboard.IsHeld`).
