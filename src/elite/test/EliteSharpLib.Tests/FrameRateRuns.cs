/// <remarks>
/// Each test used to start its own pair of runs, so seven tests played the
/// game fourteen times for eight distinct runs. Worse, the two throttle tests
/// stopped part way up a ramp the longer runs pass through anyway. A run
/// records the speed as it goes by, so the flight pair also serves the launch
/// throttle test and the docking pair serves both halves of the autopilot's,
/// leaving four runs in total.
